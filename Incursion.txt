Introduction
============

Incursion is a fantasy roguelike where you play as an adventurer in a dungeon.
Help is provided in-game, along with copious amounts of detail.

This version is a continuation of the open source release of 0.9.6H4,
which it should be noted is earlier than the last official binary release
of 0.6.9I.  The missing differences are unknown.

Project goals
=============

To fix bugs and where the original intention is clear, implement missing
functionality.

This is a beta release of something you did not pay money for.  Use it at your
own risk, and exercise your right to not use it if it makes you unhappy.

When the beta is sufficiently stable and complete, an alpha line 0.6.9Z
will be released.  After a period of time, an official release will be
made of a 0.7 version.

Frequently asked questions
==========================

 Q. When I press a movement key, it sends two keypresses?
 A. Turn off numlock. You are using a keypad on a full keyboard.  SDL2 does not support differentiating between number keypad presses, and number key presses.
