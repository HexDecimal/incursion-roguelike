      \n<2>\n__Humans are the most adaptable and numerous race found 
      on Therya, the standard by which the other races -- demihuman 
      and darkling alike -- are measured. They are also the youngest 
      of the major races, and arguably the most ruthless. Humanity
      conquers wilderness, builds cities, develops economies and drives
      back the primevil chaos by their very nature. It is mankind that
      founded the Great Empire, even if a hobbit now carries the title
      of Empress.
        Human abilities reflect the race's diverse and adaptable nature.
      They receive bonus Feats to reflect their prowess, take advantage of
      special skills at character creation to reflect their diversity and
      despite starting with no attribute modifiers, they have the potential
      to develop their attributes beyond the maximums of any other race.
      
      \n\n<10>HUMAN RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __Humans have no devoted areas of specialization the way most of
      the other races do. They may choose any two skills to treat as
      racial skills. 
      
      \n\n<10>HUMAN RACIAL TRAITS<2>
      \n__*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- Humans are diverse and have no special
      or favoured racial weapons.
      \n__*_<7>Inherent Potential<2> -- While elves are on average more
      graceful than humans, dwarves hardier and orcs stronger, there
      exist legendary heros from within the human race that exceed the
      capacity of all the other races. In game terms, humans can gain
      increased benefit from inherent adjustments to their ability
      scores. While the other races can gain a maximum inherent bonus
      to any one ability score of +5, humans can gain inherent bonuses
      to a single ability totalling +8.
      \n__*_<7>Versatility<2> -- Humans are the quickest learners, and
      the most adaptable to new situations, of any race living on Therya.
      They gain bonus feats at 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level -- these
      being chosen from the full list of feats in the game. Humans also gain
      an additional 2 skill points at every level they advance. Finally,
      humans consider every class to be a favoured class, and can thus
      multiclass freely without fear of an experience penalty.
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Humans start with food rations, a
      medium backpack and torches.";
      /*
      \n__[ In the final release of Incursion, the length of a full game
      will be much greater than it currently is now, and will give the
      player time to 'max out' the majority of her ability scores, making
      this a very powerful advantage indeed. In the current game, no such
      condition exists. To balance this, humans are given an extra perk
      as well: when they read an ability-boosting tome, that ability is
      increased by 1d2 points more than it would normally be. For example,
      a Manual of Clear Thought +3 would grant 1d2+3 points of Intelligence
      rather than the normal, fixed 3. ]

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Rogue, Mage\n
      \n__In ancient gnomish legends, a 'kobold' is a demon of the mines;
      a creature who poisons wells, snuffs out lantern flames, kidnaps
      children and pricks captured maidens with a thousand pins. In this
      particular case, the legend is completely true. Kobolds are the
      darkling counterpoint to gnomes, the corrupted form of that race.
      For countless millenia the two races have waged an underground war
      unseen by human eyes -- for as sociable as the gnomes are, they do
      not discuss this particular topic, and the kobolds themselves shy
      away from human sight and daylight alike.
      \n__Revelling in sabotage, trickery and guerilla warfare, kobolds
      are far more dangerous than most major powers give them credit for
      -- and that's exactly how they prefer it remain. Physically, they
      are small, dog-like creatures, but possess scales instead of fur.
      They are weak but very nimble, and have sharp claws and gleaming
      red eyes. Their overall racial alignment tendancies are toward chaos
      and evil.
      \n__Kobold adventurers are most often those that have grown tired of
      the sheer pettyness and malicious immaturity of their own society.
      Whether good or evil, they have higher ambitions than collapsing
      mines, stealing tools and curdling milk for the simple spite of
      such acts.
      \n\n
      <10>KOBOLD RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __Kobolds rely heavily on their skills, using cunning, ingenuity and
      treachery to fell their enemies. They receive Climb, Find Weakness,
      Hide, Mining, Poison Use and Handle Device as racial skills.
      \n\n
      <10>KOBOLD RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>-4 Strength, -2 Charisma<2> -- Kobolds are simply weak and
      cowardly creatures; they inherently possess neither force of body
      nor force of personality, and are well-known for fleeing from any
      encounter they cannot overcome through trickery.\n
      __*_<7>+4 Dexterity<2> -- Kobolds are agile for their size, with a
      cautious gate and the ability to strike with surprising speed and
      accuracy in a fight.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Intelligence<2> -- Kobolds are crafty and cunning, well
      given to planning and mental challenges.\n
      __*_<7>Small<2> -- Kobolds are considered to be Small creatures,
      which gives them certain mechanical advantages and weaknesses. They
      cannot wield Large weapons and must used two hands to wield a Medium
      weapon, they have a 10% penalty to hit points and their carrying
      capacity is 3/4ths that of a Medium-size creature. However, they
      receive a +2 size bonus to DC and to all attack rolls, and their
      smaller stature lets them navigate tunnels that a human could
      never fit into.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- Most kobolds gain some experience
      with weapons that highlight trickery and cunning. The whip is
      favoured for its ability to disarm opponents that rely on weapons
      and the bolas are used to incapacitate foes so that they can
      be dispatched later. Kobolds proficient with the Flexible or
      Simple weapon groups are automatically proficient with the whip,
      and those who are proficient with Thrown weapons are automatically
      proficient with bolas.\n
      __*_<7>Infravision<2> -- Like the majority of the races who dwell
      underground, kobolds possess infravision to a range of 60 feet (6
      squares).\n
      __*_<7>Trapcraft<2> -- Kobolds know and understand traps, snares
      and mechanical dangers better than members of any other race -- and
      they have no aversion to using this knowledge maliciously. They gain
      a +4 racial bonus to the Handle Device skill, and this bonus counts
      as if it were actual skill ranks for determining the level of any
      traps that they set.\n
      __*_<7>Flawless Dodge<2> -- Kobold wardancing is a sight to behold, as
      the tiny creatures skitter, jump and even climb along their enemies'
      bodies in order to evade blows. The effect is not unlike a panicked
      cat -- but cats are not nearly as agile as a terrified kobold. In
      game terms, a kobold character can activate this special ability
      once per day to automatically evade up to three plus their primary
      Dexterity modifier attacks that would have otherwise hit them. If
      they deactivate it before all the attacks are expended, they may
      activate it again later to evade the remaining number of attacks.\n
      __*_<7>Poison Immunity<2> -- Repeated experimentation and exposure,
      combined with their natural reptilian physiology, has made kobolds
      immune to the effects of all non-magical toxins.\n
      __*_<7>Evasion<2> -- Kobolds are agile creatures with good instincts
      and peerless reflexes. They receive three levels of the Evasion
      ability when they reach 3rd character level. What this means is that
      they gain Evasion (as a rogue or monk), and if they have rogue or
      monk levels, they will gain Improved Evasion three levels sooner
      than they normally would; for example, a kobold monk gains Improved
      Evasion at 6th level.\n
      __*_<7>Devious Feats<2> -- Kobolds receive the Close-Quarters
      Fighting, Dirty Fighting and Weapon Finesse feats for free at 1st
      level. Despite their weak bodies, kobolds can be dangerous opponents
      if they are allowed to plan and choose the battle.\n
      __*_<7>Swarm<2> -- Like goblins, kobolds excel at overwhelming stronger
      foes by sheer force of numbers alone. For each non-hostile Small
      creature they have within one square of them, they receive a +1 swarm
      bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and a +1 bonus to Defense.\n
      __*_<7>Natural Weapons<2> -- Kobolds have needle-sharp teeth and claws.
      They may claw for 1d4 points of damage twice, and bite for 1d6 points
      of damage. Because of their natural attacks, kobolds are never considered
      unarmed for the purposes of provoking attacks of opportunity.\n
      __*_<7>Verminfriend<2> -- Kobolds have a strong natural affinity for
      insects and insectile creatures. Vermin of animal intelligence and no
      outside motive will generally not be hostile to kobolds, and kobolds
      can train and befriend them just as other races do domestic animals. 
      This ability functions identically to the Animal Empathy skill, but 
      affects vermin instead of animals and uses the kobold's character 
      level in place of the skill rating.\n
      __Insects are also the only non-kobold creatures known to elicit feelings
      of compassion and friendship from the typical kobold.
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Kobolds start with a small
      backpack, cured meat, potions of dimension door, a whip, bolas, a random 
      defensive item and some poison; some may also have a pickaxe.\n\n
      <10>KOBOLD SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Alone among the major races of Theyra, the kobolds have no specific
      ethnic divisions or racial strands. The uniformity of their race, even
      across the vast geographical divides of continents, is a matter of
      much speculation to gnome sages.";

      \n
      \n__Jovial, optimistic and deeply passionate, gnomes have adapted extremely
      well to the modern world of Therya. Like halflings, they blend seamlessly
      into human societies, and unlike the more xenophobic (and thus receeding)
      elven and dwarven peoples, gnomes have achieved great success as a race,
      and their population in continually growing. Their services as craftsmen,
      engineers, entertainers and scholars are always being sought out by human
      settlements and communities, and their reputation for honesty and solid
      craftsmanship often makes them seem more trustworthy than the opportunistic
      halflings.\n
      __Gnomes are social beings, as extroverted, liberal and expressive as their
      cousins, the dwarves, are stoic and reserved. Their easygoing candor makes
      them a welcome addition to most social circles, and their penchant for
      pranks and practical jokes is generally benevolent in cast. Gnomes do not
      have the strong ties of clan and honour that bind dwarves (though they are
      fiercely loyal to the much-revered king of their race), and treat friendship
      as the highest bond one can possess.\n
      __Gnomes have an inherent love of process, of the hows and whys of any kind
      of system -- mechanical, social or even cosmological. Gnomish religion
      depicts the universe as a massive blueprint, sacred not only for its beauty
      but for the focused intent of its design and the complex interdependancy of
      all its subsystems. While ancient gnomish society was theorically a monarchy,
      in practice it has historically been more of a republic, a vast bureaucracy
      which intertwines the complex castes and clans of gnome society. Just as
      halflings seem inherently drawn to the merchant houses of Therya, so are
      gnomes involved with government and civic management, finding work as various
      sorts of civil servants more frequently than in any other niche. (This has
      led to a friendly, but still competitive, rivalry between the two demihuman
      races in the business world.) The typical
      gnome adventurer does what she does not for money, power, glory, moral altruism
      or even excitement, but in order to reveal the process of the world, to 
      understand how diverse and seemingly unrelated factors come together to
      form a coherant and ordered tapestry.
      \n\n
      <10>GNOME RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __Gnomes are especially adept at mechanics, chemistry and engineering. As
      such, they receive Alchemy, Craft, Handle Device, Mining and Use Magic
      Device as racial skills. While not every gnome can craft illusions, those
      that take up magecraft benefit from an innate aptitude for it, having a
      +4 racial bonus to Illusioncraft.
      \n\n
      <10>GNOME RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>+2 Intelligence<2> -- Gnomes are clever and innovative creatures,
      taking naturally to the study of mechanics, maths, magecraft and other
      abstract fields of study. They enjoy puzzles, wordcraft and intellectual 
      pursuits.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Wisdom<2> -- Conversely, gnomes can often be foolhardy,
      oblivious, blinded by idealism or generally unworldly. They are at heart
      frivolous and whimsical creatures, and sometimes have trouble staying
      focused on the situation at hand or applying basic common sense to
      something that can be addressed (and overcomplicated) by more systematic
      methodologies.\n
      __*_<7>Small<2> -- Gnomes are considered to be Small creatures,
      which gives them certain mechanical advantages and weaknesses. They
      cannot wield Large weapons and must used two hands to wield a Medium
      weapon, they have a 10% penalty to hit points and their carrying
      capacity is 3/4ths that of a Medium-size creature. However, they
      receive a +1 size bonus to DC and to all attack rolls, and their
      smaller stature lets them navigate tunnels that a human could
      never fit into.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- The same mechanical aptitude that makes
      gnomes adept at devices and crafts makes them indirectly well-suited
      to the use of crossbows. While gnomes are not specifically accurate 
      with such weapons, their agile hands and knowledge of gears and
      tension allows them to reload crossbow with alacrity. They begin with
      the Rapid Reload feat at first level, and gnome warriors and rangers
      are automatically proficient with the cranquin.\n
      __In addition, gnomes who are proficient with the Long Blades weapon group
      are also considered proficient with the use of the mercurial broadsword,
      which is an exotic weapon for any other race.\n
      __*_<7>Illusioncraft<2> -- Gnomes have a strong inborn magical gift: the
      power of illusion. Gnome characters gain certain spell-like abilities as
      they advance in level to represent this. At 1st level, they may use 
      <9>ventrilloquism<2> at will. At 3rd level, they gain <9>mirror image<2>;
      at 7th, <9>displacement<2>.\n
      __This ability also grants gnomes a +2 bonus to saving throws versus
      illusions, and a +4 racial bonus to the Illusioncraft skill.\n
      __*_<7>Arcane Trickery<2> -- Gnomes lack the everyday willpower and
      determination of Elves or Dwarves, but their crafty minds are well
      suited to lateral thinking, especially on a mystical level. Three
      times per day, they may discern a way to slip a spell past a foe's
      defenses, finding a metaphysical chink in their armour and increasing
      the save DC of the spell in question by +8.\n    
      __*_<7>Burrow Kinship<2> -- Gnomes have a certain kinship with burrowing
      mammals: rabbits, foxes, badgers and so forth. The can communicate with
      these creatures empathically, and are often able to befriend them or
      receive aid from them. Essentially, this is a limited form of the Animal
      Empathy skill, and uses the gnome's character level in lieu of a skill
      rating.\n
      __*_<7>Stonework Sense<2> -- Though not the equal of the dwarves, gnomes
      still have an exceptional aptitude for mining and stonecraft. They can
      sense the same things dwarves can, but their sense functions identically
      to that of a dwarf of twice their level.\n
      __In addition, gnomes are familiar with all manner of gems, and receive
      a +5 racial bonus to all checks made to identify gemstones, which they 
      covet highly.\n
      __*_<7>Kobold Slayer<2> -- Gnomes have fought the kobolds for many
      centuries, and their perpetual cheer is dampened by the fact that just
      about every gnome has lost someone to a kobold ambush or prank at one
      time or another. Gnomes have studied kobolds in great detail, and
      receive the favoured enemy bonuses against them in melee.\n
      __*_<7>Freedom of Movement<2> -- Gnomes are inherently immune to all
      magical effects that paralyze them, entangle them, petrify them, or
      otherwise slow or limit their movement. This is said to be a special
      sign of favour from the goddess Essiah.\n
      __*_<7>Scent<2> -- Like orcs, gnomes have a highly developed sense of
      smell, and can track enemies by smell and locate them when they are
      within 20 feet (2 squares).
      __*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Gnomes start with a gnomish backpack,
      a brass lantern, food rations, two random wands, a crossbow (a cranquin
      for warriors and rangers, otherwise an arbalest) and bolts if they are
      proficient with such, and a pickaxe. Gnomes proficient with long blades 
      and with a Strength of 15 or higher also begin with a mercurial 
      broadsword.\n\n
      
      <10>GNOME SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Rock gnomes' inherent magic is tied more to stone than to
      illusion; they speak with it as if it were a living force in
      and of itself. They tend to live in isolated mountain settlements,
      have developed a shamantic religion around the worship of their
      Lords of the Earth and are responsible for building the strange
      stone circles that focus mana, scattered across isolated locales
      across Theyra's surface.\n
      __Forest gnomes are sylvan creatures, possession an affinity
      toward things faerie without having fallen into Queen Maeve's
      thrall. They have an inherent kinship and empathy with forest
      creatures.\n
      __Deep gnomes have been altered somewhat by having lived so
      long in the depths of the Underdark. They have no affinity for
      illusions, and they were not around to receive Essiah's
      blessing, but they have highly diverse innate spell-like
      abilities, and like many Underdark creatures are also highly
      resistant to magic.\n
      __Craft gnomes are the newest gnome subrace, driven by a desire
      to advance their technological understanding as a race an a
      great affinity for devices of all kinds. These gnomes are more
      common in human cities than in the more sheltered gnome communities,
      where they are regarded as potentially dangerous.\n
      __Spirit gnomes are physically the smallest of the gnome subraces,
      and also the rarest. They are well known as scholars, keepers of
      secrets, detectives and antiquarians; perhaps the greatest of their
      secrets is the origin of their subrace itself. They have an affinity
      for psionics and stealth, sharp senses and a lifespan far above that
      of normal gnomes.";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Warrior, Priest
      \n
      \n__Stubborn, driven, stoic and devoted -- these are the traits
      the dwarven people are most known for. A warrior race, dwarves
      have fought for millenia against the giants, orcs, aberrations
      and other monsterous threats that plague civilization. Ironically,
      this very devotion has ultimately put them at odds with the very
      world they strove to protect -- dwarves are a highly conservative
      people, with a great regard for the status quo and the honour of
      the clans, and as such they do not tend to interact well with the
      modern, metropolitan human cities that dot Therya's surface. The
      dwarves respond to a world they no longer understand with 
      xenophobia, retreating to their mountain fortresses and Underdark
      enclaves; some clans' kings go so far as to restrict any contact
      with outsiders. As a result, dwarves are very rarely seen among
      the throngs of major cities, and their cultural development has
      all but stagnated as a result.\n
      __Dwarven society is highly traditional (some would say hidebound),
      patriarchal (misogynistic), honour-conscious (warlike) and ritualistic
      (obsessive-compulsive). The sheer unbending willfulness that gave
      them the strength to fight on when other races had fled in less
      civilized times may now turn them into a barrier that humanity --
      or a less forgiving race -- will eventually have to break due to
      the sheer difficulty of negotiation. While the signs are subtler,
      times are turning against the dwarves every bit as much as they
      are against the elves, and the future of their people looks grim
      indeed.\n
      \n 
      <10>DWARVEN RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __Each dwarf begins her adult life as an apprentice to a miner,
      master craftsman, or warrior. As a result, dwarves have an even
      tighter set of racial skills than most races, and almost all
      dwarves have some proficiency in one or more of their racial
      skills. These skills are Craft and Mining.
      \n\n
      <10>DWARVEN RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>Stonework Sense<2> -- Dwarves' racial affinity for mining
      lends them an intuitive sense for stone and stonework. Dwarves can
      easily spot pit traps, secret doors, concealed rockfalls and similar
      constructions in a dungeon. In an underground setting, they can
      sense secrets doors just as elves do.\n
      __In game terms, what this means in that dwarves receive a +2 bonus to
      saving throws versus traps when in a dungeon setting, as well as a +2
      racial bonus to the Search, Craft and Mining skills. More interestingly,
      they always 'see' the type of stone 10 feet (1 square) in past the walls
      of the dungeon, allowing them to spot good areas to dig for ores, gems
      and other treasure.\n
      __*_<7>Magic Resistance<2> -- Dwarves have an inborn tolerance for
      magic, receiving a +2 racial bonus to saving throws versus spells at
      first level, increasing by +1 every 6th level.\n 
      __*_<7>Giant-Killer<2> -- When fighting humanoid creatures larger than 
      themselves, dwarves gain a +4 bonus to their defence class,
      representing certain racial fighting techniques specifically taught
      to each dwarf during their apprenticeship period. The threat range of
      all their attacks (armed, unarmed or ranged) also increased by one
      against giant-size enemies.\n
      __*_<7>Earth Affinity<2> -- Dwarves possess a deep spiritual tie with
      the base element of earth, and this is reflected in their magic. When a
      dwarf casts a spell or uses a magical device with the [Earth] descriptor,
      she gains a +2 bonus to the dweomer's save DC, a +1 bonus to her effective
      caster level and spends only half (round up) the normal mana cost. When a 
      dwarf makes a social skill check against a creature with the Earth Creature 
      subtype, she gains a +2 social modifier to her roll.\n
      __*_<7>Dwarven Focus<2> -- When a dwarf deticates himself to a given task,
      there is no standing between him and its completion. For this reason,
      dwarves gain bonuses in combat based on their level against a single
      unique creature they are sworn to kill -- often the central enemy of a
      given quest or task. When a dwarf wants to use this ability, he must
      choose a single creature within his line of sight that is a worthy foe
      (possessed of a Challenge Rating equal to his character level). Then,
      the following effects apply:\n
      __<7>*<2>_The dwarf receives a +2 circumstance bonus to hit and damage the
      creature in question, but suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to hit and damage
      against all enemies that are not directly allied with his focus.\n
      __<7>*<2>_The dwarf receives a +4 morale bonus to Will saves of all
      kinds -- quite literally nothing will turn him away from his appointed
      goal.\n
      __<7>*<2>_The dwarf receives three temporary fatigue points that remain
      with him until his enemy is slain. If losing these causes him to faint
      from exhaustion when the deed is done, then so be it.\n
      __<7>*<2>_The dwarf cannot voulantarily leave the level he is currently
      on, so long as the creature remains on it. If he invoulantarily leaves
      the level (such as by means of a pit trap), he suffers a penalty of 200 
      experience points per character level and the focus is broken.\n
      __<7>*<2>_The dwarf cannot choose to rest until his nemesis is slain.\n
      __<7>*<2>_When the dwarf finally kills his focus enemy, he receives bonus
      experience equal to 50 times the enemy's Challenge Rating. He cannot then
      choose another focus enemy until he has rested.\n
      __<7>*<2>_If the enemy dies from some cause other than the dwarf's attacks,
      the dwarf similarly suffers a 200 experience point per character level
      penalty, and the focus is of course finished.\n
      __*_<7>Infravision<2> -- Dwarves are naturally able to see clearly in
      perfect darkness, having infravision to a range of 60 feet (6 squares).\n
      __*_<7>Weaponcraft<2> -- While magical arms and armour are usually
      crafted by spellcasters arcane or divine, dwarves without any other
      magical skill have been known to craft such items, simply as a result
      of the deep spiritual tie that exists between a dwarven weaponsmith
      and his craft.  In game terms, dwarves receive the Craft Magical Arms
      and Armour feat for free at 7th level, and may use their base attack
      bonus in lieu of a caster level when forging such items.\n
      __*_<7>Armour Use<2> -- For dwarves, wearing encumbering armour is a
      way of life. All dwarves have the Armour Proficiency (Heavy) feat for
      free. Dwarves who gain one or more levels as a paladin, warrior or 
      priest gain the Armour Optimization feat for free and suffer
      only one-third of the normal Skill Check and Movement Rate penalties
      when wearing armour. They are not particularly agile, but dwarves are
      hardly helpless when covered in metal.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- Dwarves who are proficient with the Axes
      weapon group are automatically considered to be proficient with the
      dwarven waraxe -- normally an exotic weapon. Furthermore, dwarves
      treat the battleaxe and warhammer as Simple weapons.\n
      __*_<7>Orc Slayer<2> -- Dwarves have been at war with the orcs and 
      goblins since the Dawn Times, conflicting over their racial territories 
      beneath the earth. This racial 'tradition' has resulted in a body of lore 
      and special training for fighting these races that grants dwarves increased
      chances to hit and increased damage (as per a Ranger's Chosen Enemies)
      against orcs and goblins.
      \n__*_<7>Fatigue Regeneration<2> -- Dwarves are so hardy that they
      can actually recover fatigue without sleeping. A dwarf that
      goes 100 turns without being involved in combat recovers one point
      of fatigue and then recovers an additional point of fatigue every 50
      turns thereafter. 
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Dwarves start with a medium
      backpack, food rations and a pickaxe. Dwarven warriors and barbarians
      start with a dwarven waraxe, while other dwarves proficient with
      impact weapons start with a warhammer. All starting weapons and armour 
      are assumed to be dwarven-forged: heavy, hard and protective.  
      \n\n
      <10>DWARF SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Shield dwarves are the most common of the dwarven subraces, and are
      described by the traits given above. (Unlike most other races, dwarves
      don't tend to breed outside their ethnicity, meaning that almost all
      dwarves belong to one specific subrace.)\n
      __Forge dwarves have a special affinity for fire and metalcraft, and
      tend to dwell in iron citadels close to active magma flows. They are
      the most rigid and driven of all the dwarven subraces, labouring under
      a secret shame their subrace supposedly bears from the primordial
      history of the dwarves. (The Azer are an offshoot of forge dwarves,
      taking the nature of their race to an even greater extreme.)\n
      __Mountain dwarves consider themselves to be nobility among dwarves,
      and are (marginally) more outgoing than the other subraces. They are
      most famous for the beautiful and functional mountain citadels that
      they carve from solid stone. They have a strong aptitude for leadership
      and inspiration.\n
      __Jungle dwarves are almost unseen in the Kinlands, hailing from far-off
      Angla Maua. They are primitive and tribal, though every bit as honourable
      and ritualistic as any other dwarves, and are renouned for their skill
      in wilderness survival and woodcraft, having a strong prediliction toward
      the ranger class.\n
      __Gray dwarves are a degenerate and evil dwarven subrace, with a very
      limited intelligence and no concept of honour or nobility. They tend to
      dwell deep in the Underdark and possess potent innate magics. Gray dwarves
      are psychologically weak and craven, and it is said that they compose
      the portion of the dwarven race that did not have the strength of
      spirit to resist diabolical corruption in the primevil birth of the
      dwarven race.";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Mage, Ranger
      \n
      \n__The most secretive of the common races, elves are only very
      rarely seen in human settlements, and their lack of common presence
      lends to the race a mystique of nearly mythical proportions.
      Creatures of pure magic, some have called them, able to hear the
      heartbeat of the world. Many fairy tales feature of elven sorceror,
      sage or faerie lover, a being whose immortal grandeur and passions
      are matched only by his wisdom and goodness. Humanity is fascinated
      by the elves, their splendour and paegentry, but rarely sees what
      transpires in their shrouded courts. That's probably for the better,
      actually.
      \n__Born of the breeding between faeries -- a race known for fine
      music, immortal passions and terrible cruelty -- and humanity, the
      elves are ever creatures of two worlds: one foot mired in mundane
      matters while the other drifts off into the callow abstractions
      of the Realm of Faerie, the domain of Queen Maeve. Wicked and selfish,
      Maeve holds the elven race in thrall to her as a result of ancient
      geasa and pacts, and the high elven lords maneuver within this bondage
      to do what they can to avoid harming the world and, hopefully, one
      day earn their race's freedom.
      \n__Poets speak of elves as if they dwelled figuratively in a world
      of dreams, as well as literally -- and there is some truth in this.
      Elves are given to proud idealism and legendary romances, and often
      have a tremendous amount of trouble relating to the mundanities of
      the real world. Like sleepwalkers, they move through the world with
      only a vague understanding of its causes and details, seeking to
      complete drives even they do not fully understand. It is said that
      the motives of elves are known only to the elves, but this isn't
      really true; even the elves themselves often have no understanding
      of the overall design behind their goals and actions.
      \n__Perhaps humanity is wise to be fearful, as well as fascinated,
      by these strange and ethereal beings. 
      \n\n 
      <10>ELVEN RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __The elves are a civilized peoples with great regard for culture
      and learning. Their innate grace also gives them certain aptitudes
      that humans do not possess. Their racial skills are Knowledge (Magic), 
      Listen, Move Silently and Perform.
      \n\n
      <10>ELVEN RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>+2 Dexterity<2> -- Elves are inherently graceful in their
      motions, both as a result of superior physical motor control and
      through living in a culture that teaches elegance in movement as
      an essential part of social station. Elves excel at archery,
      fencing, dancing and stealth as a result.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Charisma<2> -- There is a certain indescribable element
      of faerie glamour to the elven peoples that makes them alluring
      to humanity, and to all the less magical races. It is not only
      beauty or refinement, though elves possess both of these in spades,
      but also a sense of fundamental, primevil mystery that surronds
      these creatures and makes them so very compelling to the mortal
      beings who interact with them.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence<2> -- An elf who reaches adulthood
      is over a century in age, having accumulated the full experiences
      of a human lifetime in his youth. Many of the greatest elven heros
      have lived a full millenia before accomplishing their grandest
      deeds. Their wisdom truly is immortal, having seen the rise and
      fall of entire human kingdoms, and they have a human lifetime in
      which to pursue their early education.\n
      __*_<7>-1 Strength, -1 Constitution<2> -- Elves are frail of build, 
      not being nearly as rugged, powerful or resilient as the heavier 
      races like the humans, dwarves or lizardmen.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- All elves are familiar with the use
      of the long bow, short bow, long sword and rapier.\n
  	  __*_<7>Magical Nature<2> -- As inherently magical creatures with a
	    far greater attunement to the tapestry of life than humans, elves
	    receive an extra 5 mana points at the start of the game, and an
	    extra point for every character level they achieve above 1st.\n
      __*_<7>Manifestation<2> -- By drawing her ancient magical essence
      to the surface of her being, an elf can manifest a tiny fragment
      of her race's true faerie grandeur in the corporeal world, becoming
      a beautiful and terrifying thing to behold. The elf's Charisma score
      gains an enhancement bonus of +4, her presence is so overwhelming
      that she gains a +2 awe bonus to Defense versus foes that are not
      blind or mindless, and she radiates light and warmth with an effect
      identical to the <9>faerie fire<2> spell. Most importantly, however,
      a manifest elf exists in all three worlds (corporeal, ethereal and
      astral) at once, and thus can strike (and be struck by) incorporeal
      creatures with full effect.\n
      __Manifestation only lasts for a short time (1d4 rounds, plus one
      round per full three character levels), and it is also extremely
      tiring, costing the elf a full 5 Fatigue Points to use.\n
      __*_<7>Wrought Iron<2> -- Wrought Iron is an anathema to elves and
      their fae nature. Any wrought iron weapon that strikes an elf deals
      and additional 2d6 points of damage (which bypasses armour). Orcs
      are known to craft and carry wrought iron weapons. \n
      __*_<7>Reverie<2> -- Elves do not sleep as humans do; part of their
      pact with Maeve bars them forever from the realm of dreams. Instead,
      elves enter a meditative state they call reverie, allowing their
      bodies and minds to rest and recover in a small fraction of the time
      it takes humans to sleep -- a typical period of reverie lasts only
      an hour or two.\n
      __In game terms, elf characters have a drastically reduced chance of
      random encounters when resting, and furthermore when they do suffer
      an encounter their foes do not get the same degree of surprise over
      them -- an elf in reverie is vaguely aware of the world around him,
      and can come to his senses nearly instantly.\n
      __*_<7>Sharp Senses<2> -- Elves have exceptionally acute senses, and
      receive a +2 insight bonus to all sensory-based skills (Search, Spot,
      and Listen) at 1st level, as well as a +20 foot range to the effective
      radius of their light for the purposes of detailed vision. \n
      __Additionally, elves automatically make a Search check whenever they
	  step within 10 feet of a secret door that has not already been searched
	  for once before their last period of rest.\n
      __*_<7>Lowlight Vision<2> -- An extension of their sharpened senses,
      elves are able to see 20 feet (2 squares) further in total than a
      human could in torchlight or similar conditions. \n
      __*_<7>Temprature Tolerance<2> -- Elves are less affected by extremes
      of heat and cold than other humanoids, and enter play with two points
      each of Fire and Cold Resistance.\n
      __*_<7>Tied to Life<2> -- Elves are attuned to nature and to the
      cycles of life on a metaphysical level, and view these things as
      sacred and taboo in ways few others can understand -- even evil elves
      understand this bond. As a result of this tie, the same force that
      makes sylvan creatures instinctually trust elves renders them
      completely incapable of ever invoking the magics of Necromancy.
      They cannot learn any Necromancy spells, become specialists in the
      school of Necromancy, use necromatic magical items, command the undead 
      or in any other way benefit from death magic.\n
      __The one exception is that they can learn Necromancy/Abjuration spells
      such as <9>protection from undead<2>, which shield against necromantic
      powers rather than evoking them.\n
      __In lieu of necromanctic practices, evil elven mages tend to
      become Enchanters of terrifying power and beauty, dominating all
      around them with charms and charisma and weaving terribly subtle
      plans whose completion may take centuries.\n
      __*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Elves start with a medium
      backpack, elven waybread, a bow, a long sword or rapier, and torches. 
      They begin play with a magical ring -- elves excel at the crafting of
      rings -- as well as equal chance of either a cloak or boots of 
      elvenkind. Starting armour and weapons are assumed to be of Elven make 
      and are thus ligher, faster and less restrictive than normal.\n
      __Elves also start out worshipping Maeve unless their choice of class
      allows them to pick a god. If it does, then choosing a god other than
      Maeve causes Maeve to be angered at the start of the game.\n\n
      <10>ELF SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Gray elves are reclusive and frail, physically weak but possessed of
      incredible mystical and intellectual potency. Not a true ethnicity,
      they are instead a metamorphosed form of normal elves, having survived
      for over a millenia and attained true immortality through spiritual
      kinship to the realm of Faerie. Gray elves are terribly wise creatures,
      but also filled with grief, for their race's bondage to Maeve strikes
      them more deeply than any other elves.\n
      __Wood elves are the least civilized of the elven peoples, possessed
      of great strength, wild cunning and an affinity for sylvan creatures
      of all kinds. They tend to be xenophobic and conservative, scorning
      the ways of humanity and blaming mankind for the travails of their
      race.\n
      __Twilight elves are born with more of Faerie in their veins than most,
      literally slipping in and out of the ethereal plane as a natural facet
      of their existance, but vulnerable to the light of the sun and given
      over to periods of irrational behaviour.";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Rogue, Mage
      \n
      \n__No race, save perhaps the kobolds, is more widely despised than
      the drow. Treacherous, deceitful, chaotic, power-hungry and supremely
      skillful, the drow are an offshoot of elves who sought freedom from
      Maeve through pacts with tanari and other profane powers. Living deep
      beneath the earth in the depths of the Underdark, the only mention of
      drow that most surface folk hear is when their skilled and murderous
      raiding parties attack humanity or the surface elves, whom they
      consider to be wretched slaves. Drow have no part in the surface culture
      of Therya, at least not in the Kinlands, and the rare individuals who
      leave the Underdark to explore the Kinlands are rogues and outcasts,
      most often having gotten the short end of some political maneuvering
      in their home city and thus fleeing for their lives. Drow typically
      work as freelance assassins, given their character and aptitude for
      stealth, but strive to find any position that will make them more
      powerful or give them political leverage.
      \n__Because of the paranoid and ruthless society they were raised in,
      most drow are pathologically mistrustful, unable to develop true
      bonds of caring or friendship due to the hardship their homeland has
      inflicted on them. This is doubly true of the males, who are heavily
      abused in the matriarchal (and misandranous) society of the dark
      elves. Women are stronger (and more capriciously violent), and rule 
      their homeland through the priesthood, each city being devoted to a 
      member of the Multitude. The most common drow power is their evil, 
      cruel and nameless Spider Queen, who teaches all drow to betray 
      everything they care for in the slightest, lest is be used as a 
      weakness against them by their enemies.\n
      \n 
      <10>DROW RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __The drow racial skills are Appraise, Bluff, Move Silently and 
      Poison Use. All drow are trained in these skills from childhood,
      and failing to master them to at least some extent makes a drow
      easily manipulated by her fellows, and thus dead.\n
      __Drow receive a +2 racial bonus to Move Silently.\n\n

      <10>DROW RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>-1 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma<2> -- Drow share the
      frail frames, unearthly gracefulness and alluring beauty of their
      elven ancestors, and augment it with a heightened force of personality,
      constant agility training and the allure of true evil.\n
      __As an extention of their natural agility, all drow are ambidexterous
      and receive the Ambidexterity feat at 1st level. Because of this, drow
      warriors traditionally favour fighting with two weapons.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Intelligence<2> -- Drow think on their feet -- one has to,
      in order to remain alive in their society. This intellectual might is
      not equalled in spiritual wisdom, however; for all that their people
      are ruled by clerics, their spiritual consciousness remains effectively
      nonexistant.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Luck<2> -- Aside from incuring bad karma and making enemies
      with the same gleeful abandon of a pig in a slopheap, drow tend to
      overcomplicate their intrigues, burn their bridges and have nobody
      they can turn to when the stakes are down.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- All drow are proficient with the
      hand crossbow. The hand crossbow is a weak but accurate weapon that 
      is used by the drow to poison victims from a distance: all drow 
      missiles start the game coated with Elfshot, a poison that causes 
      sleep in its victims.\n
      __*_<7>Infravision<2> -- Drow have the sharpest infravision of any
      beings living on Therya, being able to see with absolute clarity
      out to a range of 120 feet (12 squares) when in absolute darkness.\n
      __*_<7>Innate Magic<2> -- Living amidst the magical radiations of the
      Underdark, the same power that produced the aberrations, and having
      make pacts with countless demons, drow have developed some inherent
      magical abilities. All drow may cast the spell <9>faerie fire<2> at
      will. They gain <9>globe of shadow<2> at 2rd level, and upon reaching
      3rd level they can also use <9>levitation<2> at will.\n
      __*_<7>Magic Resistance<2> -- For similar reasons, drow have developed
      an inherent magic resistance similar to that of their outer-planar
      patrons. Far more powerful than the dwarven ability, drow do not
      resist so much as simply negate magical effects cast at them. They
      have a natural 50~ magic resistance associated with their drow
      physiology and gain a +2~ inherent bonus with every character
      level.\n
      __*_<7>Sharp Senses<2> -- Drow have senses as acute as any other elf's,
      and receive identical bonuses to conventional elves in this area.
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Drow start with a medium 
      backpack, spider bread and a hand crossbow with bolts. All starting 
      metal items are forged from adamant and are thus
      extraordinarily strong and protective. All starting missile weapons
      are coated with elfshot, and all drow start with a spare vial of it.
      \n\n
      <10>DROW SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __The drow are themselves a subrace of elves that has developed
      distinctly enough to be treated as wholly seperate, and thus they have
      no further subraces within themselves. In practice, however, the drow
      females have certain additional abilities men do not, and thus are
      treated mechanically as if they were a subrace.\n
      __Drow females are stronger than men, having normal human Strength,
      and also possess several inherent magical talents that males do not --
      reading thoughts, scrying and dispelling magic. They also add priest
      to their list of favoured classes. (Later, the default Favoured Classes
      of drow will be Rogue and Wizard, plus Priest for the women.)";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Rogue, Bard\n 
      \n__Halflings are cute, clever, endearing, friendly, sociable and in 
      control of approximately a third of the Kinlands' wealth. Opportunistic 
      and ambitious, the hin have carved out a niche for themselves as the 
      dominant demihuman race in the civilized lands. While nigh-immortal 
      elves shy away from the bustle of human cities and surly dwarves bemoan 
      the loss of the old ways in their carved stone halls, the halflings 
      gleefully embrace everything the human world has to offer, becoming an 
      omnipresent factor in human cities across the globe.\n 
      __Between their crafty insight and unearthly luck, just about the only 
      thing holding the race back from outshining humanity in every endeavour 
      is their lack of ambition - halflings are stereotyped as lazy, and while 
      some make remarkable achievements, their racial culture does tend to 
      place more emphasis on creature comforts than on deeper kinds of 
      achievement. If the hin (as halflings call themselves) have a sin, it
      would be complacency; a willing lack of foresight and a desire to avoid
      any kind of discomfort, excitement or radical action plague the race.
      Halfling adventurers tend to be the glaring exception to this rule,
      having already parted ways with the norms of their race through their
      choice of career. Despite this, halflings have a strength of spirit
      that other races lack, and while they're hardly innovators they will
      stand by the things they consider important with a quiet resolve that
      cannot be shaken. As a race, they're survivors.\n
      __Despite their success, many halfling communities tend to be very
      conservative, albiet in a very different way from the dwarves. The
      little folk tend to see themselves as the most supremely civilized
      people in the world, a born aristocracy, and their tendancy toward
      gossip makes them highly paranoid about potential scandals. They
      enjoy living a high standard of life and being socially acceptable
      to their peers, and they thus dislike anything which might bring
      their family's social standing into question or disrupt their
      intentionally pedestrian lifestyle -- like adventurers. Many halfling
      heroes have thus ended up deeply estranged from their families,
      who live in shame of them -- and god forbid the outcast should be
      something as barbaric as a <10>warrior<2>!\n
      \n 
      <10>HALFLING RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __Racial skills are one of the strongest advantages halflings have,
      being quick learners, socially dexterous and naturally agile as
      well. The full list of halfling racial skills is Appraise, Climb, 
      Diplomacy, Hide, Intuition and Tumble.\n
      __Halflings also receive certain inherent racial bonus to skills.
      They have a +2 racial bonus to Hide, Tumble and Climb; their Hide
      racial bonus stacks with the +2 size bonus they receive to the
      Hide skill due to being Small creatures.
      \n\n
      <10>HALFLING RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>+2 Dexterity<2> -- Halflings are naturally agile, sure-footed
      and nimble. Rather than the surreal grace of the elves, they embody
      a cautious, competant precision; what would be born of careful practice
      and agility in other races comes with offhand ease to the little folk.\n
      __Another facet of halflings' natural agility is represented by them
      being easily able to slip out of the holds and grapples of larger
      opponents, receiving the Slipaway Feat for free at 1st level.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Strength<2> -- For their size, halflings are as strong as
      humans, but with their body mass it is simply impossible for the hin
      to exert the same kind of force a human does.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Charisma<2> -- Halflings are charming and sociable, and their
      small size tends to put humans at ease around them, making the larger
      folk feel safe and in control. People tell things to halflings that they
      would never imagine telling to anyone else; the hin just inspire that
      kind of trust in the people around them.\n
      __*_<7>Racial Weapons<2> -- Halflings as a race are incredibly
      skilled with the sling and other thrown weapons. They gain free
      proficiency with slings and all other thrown weapons. They gain 
      a +2 bonus to hit when using any weapon from the Thrown group,
      and have an uncanny ability to land lethal strikes when throwing
      rocks or using a sling, subtracting their Luck modifier from the
      threat range of thrown rocks or sling attacks.\n
      __*_<7>Unearthly Luck<2> -- The halfling race as a whole benefits from
      an inexplicable good fortune that draws no small degree of resentment
      from humans and other races. A halfling sometimes escapes dangers or
      accidents that could kill a human without a scratch on him. Halflings
      gain a +4 racial adjustment to their Luck score, and they add their
      Luck modifier (if positive) as a luck bonus to all of their saving
      throws.\n
      __*_<7>Psychosomatic Might<2> -- Halflings are not a race known for
      great physical strength, but when the proper motivation is placed before
      them, they are capable of bearing loads that often surprise larger folk.
      In game terms, halflings treat all food items as having a third of their
      actual weight for the purpose of calculating encumbrance.\n
      __*_<7>Strong Soul<2> -- Halflings may seek to avoid discomfort whenever
      possible, but the truth is that they also survive through ordeals that
      would break the spirit of your typical human. They love life with a
      passion, and refuse to let go of that spark in the face of things
      which threaten their spirit, debilitate their mind or weaken their
      body.\n
      __In game terms, halflings have a kind of innate hardness rating against
      ability score damage. This value begins at 1 and increases by +1 every
      third level thereafter (2 at 4th, 3 at 7th, etc.) This value is subtracted
      from any damage the halfling might suffer to one of his abilities, and if
      it exceeds the damage, no harm is done. They also receive a +2 bonus to
      save versus fear, and a +4 bonus versus death effects.\n
      __*_<7>Small<2> -- The hin are considered to be Small creatures,
      which gives them certain mechanical advantages and weaknesses. They
      cannot wield Large weapons and must used two hands to wield a Medium
      weapon, they have a 10% penalty to hit points and their carrying
      capacity is 3/4ths that of a Medium-size creature. However, they
      receive a +1 size bonus to DC and to all attack rolls, and their
      smaller stature lets them navigate tunnels that a human could
      never fit into.
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Halflings start with a small
      backpack, many tasty cottonberry loaves, a sling and some torches.
      They also begin play with a moderate supply of Hearthstones of
      Onanda -- one-use magical items that allow a guaranteed safe rest
      even in a location where encounters are possible.
      \n\n
      <10>HALFLING SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Lightfoot halflings are quick and fast, possessed of superior reflexes
      and nearly able to match pace with a human despite their smaller size.
      They have an intuitive direction sense, and tend to be more nomadic than
      most hin, possessing a string streak of wanderlust.\n
      __The Tallfellows are the largest of the halfling subraces, and also the
      strongest, nearly matching gnomes in size and build. They are a rural
      people, disliking the bustle and diversity of cities and favouring a
      simpler life on their farms. They have natural green thumbs, and an
      affinity for plants of all kinds.\n
      __Treedancer halflings are adept scouts and climbers hailing from Angla
      Maua, where they welcome visitors and turn a tidy trade in spices, rare
      minerals and other exports from the jungle continent. Their settlements
      are vast treehouse-cities mounted in the branches of great redwoods and
      linked together with an intricate webwork of rope bridges. They are the
      most societally advanced and civilized faction in Angla Maua.\n
      __Ghostwise halflings are rare, born with the ability to learn secrets
      from the wind itself. Often leaving existing halfling settlements for a
      life as a hermit or wayfarer, they study to master the strange abilities 
      of the mind -- psionics -- that they have an affinity for. They tend to
      be noble of heart and generous in spirit.\n
      __Stoutheart halflings are the strongest-willed of their race, with a
      great devotion to the ideals of family and community. They despise
      corruption in all of its forms, and become adventurers more frequently
      than other halflings in the interest of rooting out and resolving 
      something that has shaken their sensibilities. They are famed for
      their resourcefulness and clever planning.";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Druid, Warrior\n\n 
      
      __The lizardfolk are a dispassionate, patient and focused race with
      a mindset highly distant from the more humanlike races. Concerned
      first and foremost with survival -- first their own, then that of other
      species whose presence supports the existance of life overall -- the
      lizardfolk can seem ruthless or callous to mammalian races. Appearing
      as large, humanoid lizards with opposable thumbs and other biological
      adaptations to sentience, lizardfolk are strong and hardy warriors,
      and as such their favour is often sought by kings, warlords and other
      human rulers. The lizardfolk dislike this -- if they seem ruthless to
      humans, then accordingly the selfishness and wasteful conflict of human 
      politics seems incredibly degenerate and unnatural to the lizardfolk.\n
      __Though they are an intelligent race, lizardfolk generally scorn most
      of the concerns typically associated with civilization. Individual
      lizardmen have little desire for status, personal power, knowledge or
      other typical human motivations. Their goals are survival, breeding
      and the preservation of life (with no particular significance given to
      *intelligent* life, mind). They have a unique spiritual tradition that
      involves meditation and lucid dreaming, and their spiritual leaders are
      far more likely to be shamans or druids than clerics. Indeed, their
      druidic tradition is older than the human one, and lizardfolk druids
      don't seem to feel the need to answer to the human druidic hierarchy.
      Whatever accord was reached between the two groups was formed centuries
      ago, and its exact nature is highly secret.\n
      __Lizardfolk have no strong psychological or hormonal differences between
      their genders, nor do they show signs of aging until shortly before they
      die. They do have a strong seasonal rhythm built into their physiology,
      however, driving them to fight, mate, migrate or slumber. They almost
      always act on their instincts (there is no formal written language among
      the lizardfolk, let alone an educational system) but seem to have an
      almost mystical intuition -- often, lizardfolk all over the world will
      react in unison to a commonly shared threat, devastating opposition
      with their coordination without even understanding why they (as individuals)
      are doing what they are doing.\n
      \n 
      <10>LIZARDFOLK RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __The lizardfolk racial skills are not based on culture or training, but
      on the inherent aptitudes, instincts and physiology of their race. They
      receive Balance, Concentration, Intuition, Jump,
      Knowledge (Magic), Swim and Wilderness Lore as racial skills.
      \n\n         
      <10>LIZARDFOLK RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>+2 Strength, +2 Constitution<2> -- The lizardfolk are terribly strong
      by human standards, and are not only resistant to injury but also to
      disease, poison, age effects and many other kinds of maladies.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Intelligence, -2 Luck<2> -- Conversely, the lizardfolk do not
      understand conventional civilization or scholarship, have difficulty
      articulating non-trivial ideas to mammalian races and are slow to think
      and act, missing oppurtunities other races would easily catch.\n
      __*_<7>Natural Weapons<2> -- Lizardfolk have the benefit of natural
      weapons -- their natural attack sequence is to claw for 1d4+1 points of
      slashing damage, claw for 1d4+1 points of slashing damage and bite for
      1d4 points of piercing damage. They also have a natural armour rating of 
      5 against slashing, piercing and blunt damage.\n
      __*_<7>Reptilian Empathy<2> -- Lizardfolk are not entirely individual
      creatures, having a strong, shared instinctive racial empathy with each
      other. Lizardfolk can always perceive the presence of other lizardfolk
      within 180 feet, even with a solid barrier seperating them. Lizardfolk
      are almost never hostile to each other. They also share a kind of
      primitive empathy with all other reptiles, being able to simulate the
      Animal Empathy skill at a level equal to their character level when
      dealing with such creatures.\n
      __*_<7>Ancestral Memory<2> -- Lizardfolk can enter a trance-like
      state in order to use their racial memory to augment their skills,
      albiet at the cost of fatiguing themselves. At the cost of 2 fatigue
      points, they can attain the maximum possible number of ranks for a
      character of their level in any single skill - or a +4 insight bonus,
      whichever raises their total skill rating in that skill higher -- for
      a very short period of time.\n
      __*_<7>Fire Resistance<2> -- As reptiles, lizardfolk are inherently
      much less affected by heat, and their specific physiology enhances this
      effect even further. They enter play with fire resistance 5, and it
      increases by one point every odd level after 1st.\n
      __*_<7>Water Affinity<2> -- Lizardfolk possess a deep spiritual tie with
      the base element of water, and this is reflected in their magic. When a
      lizardman casts a spell or uses a magical device with the [Water] descriptor,
      he gains a +2 bonus to the dweomer's save DC, a +1 bonus to his effective
      caster level and spends only half (round up) the normal mana cost. When a 
      lizardman makes a social skill check against a creature with the Water 
      Creature subtype,
      he gains a +2 social modifier to his roll.\n
      __*_<7>Slow Metabolism<2> -- Lizardfolk grow hungry much more slowly
      than other races -- hard activity hungers them as much as anyone, but
      when they rest they use little food in comparison to mammals. By
      contrast, they require a much greater mass of food intake than mammals
      do to become Satiated. Hunger is a long-term problem for lizardfolk,
      rather than a short-term need.\n
      __*_<7>Focused Mind<2> -- Lizardfolk have an extremely linear thought
      process and instinctive responses that guide them well, giving them a
      +2 racial bonus to resist confusion effects and a +4 racial bonus to
      Concentration skill checks.\n
      __*_<7>Oily Secretion<2> -- The skin of the lizardfolk exudes a thin
      layer of a slick, oily substance when pressed, in much the same way
      humans sweat when dehydrated or when exerting themselves. This natural
      form of defense gives lizardfolk a +4 racial bonus to avoid being
      grabbed and to the grapple check to break out of a grapple.
      \n__*_<7>Starting Equipment<2> -- Lizardfolk start with a medium
      backpack, some torches, some cured meat and several vials of holy
      water -- lizardfolk frequently worship the oceans and rivers in
      the abstract, so their society gives them easy access to holy waters.
      Lizardfolk proficient with thrown weapons start with a boomerang as
      well.\n\n
      <10>LIZARDFOLK SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __The Tauri Adhami are the pureblooded nobility of the lizardfolk, reciving
      an increase in Charisma and certain mystical gifts of regency to accompany
      their noble blood.\n
      __Amahzd Tethra lizardfolk are the oldest pure bloodline of their people,
      with increased access to the lizardfolk racial memory and superior wisdom.
      They benefit from a limited ability to see the future and insight similar
      in effect to a bard's lore, but are even slower to act than normal lizardfolk
      and suffer biological swings based on the season and the weather.\n
      __The Dehezad Reigh ('the Chosen') is a mystical sisterhood of mutant lizardfolk
      born as albinos. Naturally blind, they 'see without sight' and have access to
      great mystical powers, but are also subject to limiting taboos and the strict
      authority of their sect.\n
      __The Dragonkin are a line of lizardfolk who have interbred with the dragons
      over the centuries, gaining certain of the advantages that race possesses
      but also becoming cursed with a ravenous hunger that makes them greatly feared
      and viewed as degenerate among their own race.\n
      __Their troubles pale when compared to the Nietzol Ashadrach, however. Born
      wrong, these lizardfolk lack the inherent racial empathy that most members of
      their race possess, these wretched folk are viewed as soulless and outcast
      from the lizardfolk community. They have a greater ability to adapt to human
      society as a result, and are often mistakenly called 'half-lizardfolk' by
      humans who do not understand their condition.";

      \n<15>Favoured Classes:<2> Barbarian, Priest\n
      
      \n__Brutal, crass and stupid, orcs are commonly seen as a plague
      upon the land by the more civilized races. Huge, muscular humanoids
      with faces crossing the features of men and swine, the orcs reinforce
      this connection with their savagery and their willing contentment to
      accept the lowest common denominator in all things. Orc society tends
      to be militaristic, patriarchal and driven by selfishness first and
      firemost.
      \n__Orcs are very, very rapid breeders, giving birth to litters and
      breeding frequently and casually -- along with their recent focus on
      the development of black-powder weapons, this may be the only factor
      that has allowed them to survive against dwarven prowess and human
      sociological development. On the other hand, this count be exactly
      what humanity wants -- for ages untold, it has been a human warlord
      or necromancer who gathers and leads armies of orcs, usually as a
      distraction or tactical edge that ends in their near-extermination.
      Recently, however, this has changed. Orcs were instrumental in the
      slave revolts in Mohandi, and their forces were responsible for the
      liberation of slaves from all the goodly races and central in forming
      the anarchistic 'government' that now rules there. Further, while
      only a very small percentage of the orcish race leaves the great
      fortresses and communes that house their armies and breeding pits,
      that's still a staggering number by human demographic standards, and
      now orc merchants, craftsmen and soldiers are a ubiquitous part of
      nearly every human city.        
      \n__Taken out of the oppressive squalor of their own natural society
      yet allowed to live according to their racial nature, the orc peoples
      prosper. Many orcs become great soldiers and war-heros, while others
      rise to positions of power in theives' guilds or merchant houses.
      Mostly, though, they form a silent underclass that members of all the
      'goodly' races are quite content to exploit for cheap labour and fence
      into ghettos and slums. Some scorn the stereotype, striving to be as
      intellectually developed as humans and elves, but most find more of
      corruption than virtue in the very qualities that humanity chastizes
      them for lacking. It is from this quarter, these 'city orcs' that most
      orcish adventurers rise. Sometimes these orcs return to the great orcish 
      cities, working in resistance cells to overthrow the human or baatezu 
      overseers.
      \n__A rising movement is the desire to reconstruct the true tribal customs
      of the primevil orcs, understanding how their people lived before they
      were actively bred and honed by human and daemonaic powers as cannon
      fodder. More and more now legendary orcs are rising to positions of
      great power over their people. Split in a three-way racial schism between
      the city orcs, (neo-)tribal orcs and the traditional orcs hordes, the fate
      of the entire species may very well rest in the hands of its few, brave
      heroes.\n      
      \n 
      <10>ORC RACIAL SKILLS<2>\n
      __As a race the orcs are not a skilled people; in game terms their Intelligence
      limits their skill points, and in cultural terms little emphasis is put upon
      most orcs to develop a trade. The only racial skills orcs possess are Athletics
      and Intimidate.
      \n\n
      <10>ORCS RACIAL TRAITS<2>\n
      __*_<7>+4 Strength<2> -- The strength of orcs of legendary; they are the
      strongest creatures the average human or elf will ever meet. Orc strength,
      unlike that of lizardmen or wood elves, is clearly visible -- orcs tend to
      be bulky in build, with clearly visible muscles.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Intelligence<2> -- While orcs are not the comical retards that
      human narrative often makes them out to be -- they are quite capable of
      cunning plans and foresight -- their language is limited, their culture
      scorns education and they have a very limited grasp of analytical
      reasoning.\n
      __*_<7>+2 Wisdom<2> -- Orcs tend to be determined survivors with a
      canny cunning, have a developed awareness of the world around them,
      tend to have led harsh lives that lead to stronger-held personal
      convictions and ideals and are more in tune with the primal, visceral
      element of nature that their shamans and clerics revere than the more
      civilized races.\n
      __*_<7>-2 Charisma<2> -- Orcs tend to be viewed (visually and culturally)
      as vile by members of most more refined races (and honestly, everyone is
      more refined than orcs are). Their love of crassness, and their neglect of
      hygene combine with prejudice to ensure that orcs have to make an active
      effort not to get a negative response in most social situations. Their
      anatomy, while not as groteque as it is commonly made out to be, is also
      less appealing to the typical human aesthetic than, say, an elf's.\n
      __*_<7>Militarism<2> -- The orcs are a warlike race, and every orc
      receives some degree of training in war, often from a very young
      age. All orcs, regardless of class, are proficient with the impact
      weapons group, the blades group, the spears group and the polearms
      group. In addition, the sporting competitions and training of youth
      grant orcs a familiarity with the orcish shotput.\n
      __*_<7>Toughness<2> -- Orcs are not a hardy people; their typical
      lifespan is thirty to forty years, disease takes a heavy toll on
      their numbers and their abject living conditions limit the strength
      of their constitutions.  What they are, however, it tough, and
      absolutely unwilling to give in on the field of battle. As a result,
      all orcs receive the Toughness feat for free at 1st level.\n
      __*_<7>Devouring<2> -- Orcs are much reviled for eating the bodies
      of their slain foes, but few are aware that this practice has a
      mystical component as well as a cultural one -- once, millenia
      ago, orcs would eat the bodies of elderly members of their tribes
      as a sign of respect, supernaturally allowing some small part of
      their ancestor's wisdom to live on within them. Now, it is an act
      mostly practiced only for the more worldly desire of claiming a
      fallen enemy's strength for oneself.\n
      __In game terms, an orc that eats the corpse of a creature that
      has an innate elemental resistance to a given damage type may
      develop or increase that resistance himself, provided that the
      creature's resistance level is greater than the orc's current
      inherent rating in that type of resistance.\n
      __Furthermore, certain rare monsters that are the allegorical
      representation of a given ability score can convey an inherent
      bonus to that ability when their corpses are devoured. Giants
      are so tied to Strength, elves to Dexterity, trolls to Constitution, 
      mind flayers to Intelligence, nagas to Wisdom, faeries to Charisma 
      and mythic hybrids to Luck. Dragons can convey increased mana when 
      their bodies are eaten, being creatures of pure magic.\n 
      __Finally, any living creature whose corpse is eaten provides a 
      moderate boost in experience points, provided that its Challenge 
      Rating compares well with the devourer's character level.\n 
      __*_<7>Scent<2> -- Orcs have a highly acute sense of smell, and are
      able to track their enemies by scent. They receive the Scent ability
      with a range of 30 feet.\n
      __*_<7>Infravision<2> -- Dwelling underground and upon the surface
      with equal ease, orcs have Infravision to a range of 60 feet.\n
      __*_<7>Spell Fury<2> -- Orcs are not particulairly adept at magecraft
      overall, but the sheer primal anger they bring to magical workings
      lends them a certain power as mages. In game terms, orcs double their
      Wisdom modifier on arcane spells that inflict direct physical damage.\n
      __*_<7>Light Aversion<2> -- Just as orc eyes are adapted to darkness,
      however, they suffer in light. More than just biology, orcs suffer an
      instinctual psychological aversion to daylight; it weakens their
      morale, limits vision and brings a sense of claustrophobic panic upon 
      them. Orcs suffer a -4 penalty to hit and to their defense class in
      brightly lit terrain squares (such as the area of effect of a priest's

      <10>ORC SUBRACES <5>(Unimplemented)<2>\n
      __Cave orcs are the most fecund, and most common, of the orc subraces.
      Adapted to Underdark life, the cave orcs have superior infravision, a
      racial aptitude for climbing and the ability to scale even sheer surfaces
      easily, along with an understanding of swarm tactics and an aptitude for
      underground survival, but they are even more craven than the majority of 
      the orcish race, and more intellectually stunted.\n
      __Hill orcs are the subrace that most surface orcs bear the primary blood
      of, being the result of centuries of breeding and Darwinian selection.
      Pureblood hill orcs have a stronger tie to nature through a tiny aspect 
      of racial memory; they have a limited empathy with predatory beasts and
      an aptitude for wilderness survival.\n
      __Blood orcs are bound by a blood oath to their race, and are the newest
      orc subrace. Fierce and unconquered, blood orcs draw strength both 
      mystical and psychological from their declared jihad against the peoples
      who have dominated their race throughout the years. They tend to be more
      violent, zealous, ambitious and driven than most orcs.\n
      __Black orcs were bred and engineered by Azakram the Black millenia ago
      in his campaign for conquest of the Kinlands during the Mage Wars. They
      have a heightened affinity for blood magic, a limited empathy with the
      undead and a small degree of innate mystical power, but are not as strong 
      as their compatriots and suffer from an suceptability towards enchantment 
      spells. In the modern age, the most frequently serve as shamans and other
      spiritual authorities in an orc tribe.";

      fjm: I killed this A) because of the new Rage-Fatigue system, and
        because B) I'm working to level the playing field between the
        obvious and obscure race/class combos, and there's already lots
        of incentive to be an orc barb.
      
      __*_<7>Blood Fury<2> -- Orcs have a natural racial aptitude for
      flying into a crazed fury and maiming anyone in their presence.
      The only way this is useful, however (as opposed to just antisocial)
      is if they have some training as barbarians. Using the Berserk Rage 
      class ability costs them one fewer points of fatigue then it would 
      members of any other race.\n
