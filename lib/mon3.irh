      the dark, cramped spaces in the cellar and under
      furniture, waiting for an opportunity to slay
      innocents and spread mayhem.
        This wicked creature exists only to torment and
      consume other beings. It seems to have been
      created by an evil entity or perhaps a priest, and is
      incapable of breeding. Indeed it is almost never
      found in the company of its own kind.
        A cellar dweller has a number of innate magical
      abilities that make it a highly dangerous foe, in
      spite of its diminutive stature. Staring into the eyes
      of this creature can cause temporary blindness. The
      bite of the blackened fangs of this beast will cause
      a numbing weakness to quickly spread through the
      body.
