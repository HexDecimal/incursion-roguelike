  ABILITIES AS RESOURCES:
  * EA_OVERRIDE done
  * Effects can have Ability/Stati lists very much
    like classes, and can be evoked thereof with
    GainAbilities -- these are just Annotations, so
    it is very easy to add to the resource compiler
  * Ability[] entries can be for resource abilities
    as well as constant abilities, and GainAbility
    can handle resource abilities -- easy to do.
  * EV_LISTABIL to return the listed description of
      an ability as it appears on the character sheet,
      with flags for the default formats.
  * Resource Abilities stored in a character as an
      ABILITY stati, with the ability level in Val,
      the Ability itself in eID, etc. Or later maybe
      a specialized array that can grow as abilities
      are gained, and lists the parts from different
      classes for reversion purposes. This can co-exist
      with the current ability scheme for now, but will
      eventually replace it completely.
  * EF_ACTIVATE for abilities that can be activated;
      these then show up in the 'u' list.

      <2>\n__There exist beings beyond the capacity of the minds of humans (and
           demihumans) to comprehend. Dwelling beyond the Outer Planes that
           define the human concept of the afterlife, these creatures are
           ancient, inscrutable, tremendously powerful and unbelievably alien.
           The most well known -- but certainly not the only -- representative
           of these beings on Theyra is Kysul, who serves as a guardian of any
           contact between the Prime Material and the Outer Rim, and is served
           by a handful of scattered mystery cults across the Kinlands.\n
           __The Alienist is a spellcaster who has devoted herself wholly to
           the intensely esoteric practice of summoning and dealing with these
           beings. Most would call her a madwoman, a crazed and irresponsible
           cultist that endangers the safety of all of Theyra. For some Alienists
           this accusation is true, while others are more responsible -- but no
           less feared or hated. The most common motive among alienists is
           knowledge -- knowledge of concepts and ideas that cannot exist in a
           stable manner in our reality and thus must be experienced firsthand
           in order to be understood, since human languages lack the terms to
           express them. This search for ultimate knowledge drives many alienists
           to enlightenment, damnation or both.\n
           __Alienists are not, by their nature, stable beings. They are driven
           by inhuman desire and exposed to unknowable secrets and eldritch
           beings, and as a result their minds are often deeply fractured and
           the majority of them are no longer able to relate to their original
           race in any normal way.\n
           __Many lizardfolk are alienists. Their people worshipped the Outer
           Lords long before humanity or the modern gods existed, and while the
           modern lizardfolk treat druidism as the closest thing they have to a
           state religion, alienism forms a distinct minority in their society,
           and they are the only peoples on all of Theyra (other than aberrations)
           who respect the practice of alienism. Mind flayers also sometimes become 
           alienists, though their society is fierce in the persecution of these
           forsaken scholars -- worship of Outer Lords threatens their fiercely
           regimented social structure, and they long ago turned their backs on
           their father, Kysul.

          \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
          __The alienist is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
          for all characters. In order to become an alienist, you must have:\n
          __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Knowledge (Planes) +10.\n
          __*_<7>Known Spells<2> -- Seven total spell levels of Weavecraft spells.\n
          __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Augment Summoning.\n
          __*_<7>Religion<2> -- You must worship Kysul, or no diety at all. None 
          of Theyra's other gods tolerate alienists.
                
          \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
          __The class skills of the alienist are 
          Bluff, Concentration, Decipher Script, Hide in Shadows, Intimidate, 
          Knowledge (Magic), Knowledge (Mythology), Knowledge (Oceans), 
          Knowledge (Planes), Metamagic, Move Silently, Spellcraft and
          Use Magic.
          
          \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
          __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Alienists gain no additional weapon or armour
          proficiencies.\n
          __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- At every level except 1st and 4th, alienists
          gain a new caster level. They continue to advance in arcane spell access
          if they had any before entering this class, otherwise advancing in the
          divine, druidic or other class spell list that allowed them to meet the
          caster prerequisite given above.\n
          __If the alienist has Domains, she continues to advance those as well,
          provided she is advancing as a divine caster.\n
          __*_<7>Incomprehensible Wisdom<2> -- Alienists gain the Improved Wisdom
          feat for free at 1st level. If they already have it, they can select any
          other feat to fill the free slot.\n
          __*_<7>Uneasy Mind<2> -- Alienists grow increasingly distant from humanity
          as they continue to advance in this class, and suffer a penalty equal to
          their alienist level to Diplomacy and Appraise; they also become very
          focused on distant mysteries and given to long periods of introspection,
          and being thus out of touch with the world apply this same penalty to Spot,
          Listen and Searching.\n
          __*_<7>Outer Pathways<2> -- The primary ability of the alienist class is
          the power to summon pseudonatural creatures from the far-distant realm in
          which Kysul and his kin dwell. Starting at second alienist level, any 1st-level
          <9>monster summoning<2>, <9>holy summoning<2> or <9>summon nature's ally<2>
          spell the alienist casts summons a pseudonatural version of whatever
          creature it would normally summon. At 3rd level, the 2nd-level spells are
          so altered, and so on until 10th level, when even 9th-level summoning spells
          call forth pseudonatural creatures.\n
          __In addition to the normal mana cost of the summoning spell, the pseudonatural
          summoning of an alienist drains [Summoned Creature's CR x 2] mana, and this
          mana does not regenerate.\n
          __*_<7>Surreal Presence<2> -- The sense that there is something faintly
          off, something <10>wrong<2> about the alienist crystalizes to a razor-sharp
          clarity at 3rd level, and she gains the benefit (or curse) of a constantly
          active <9>spook<2> spell as an innate supernatural ability.\n
          __*_<7>Mad Certainty<2> -- At 4th level, the alienist's fanatical devotion
          gives her a kind of ability to ignore physical harm and pursue her
          obsession with an utterly inhuman resilience even in the face of crippling
          wounds. She gains Toughness as a bonus feat and a +10 bonus to the 
          Concentration skill.\n
          __*_<7>Visitation<2> -- At 5th level, the alienist may use <9>contact other
          plane<2> at will as an innate spell-like ability.\n
          __*_<7>Inhuman Allies<2> -- At 6th level, the alienist gains the ability to
          invoke ancient pacts between the harbringers of the Outer Rim and their
          Outer Ones' more modern spawn. Aberrations are neutral to her unless she
          breaks the pact by taking some hostile action against them.\n
          __*_<7>Feverish Obsession<2> -- Upon reaching 7th level, the alienist becomes
          so driven and devoted that she develops an inhuman kind of vigor, working
          beyond the established limits of the human body. She thus regenerates fatigue
          points just as dwarves do.\n 
          __*_<7>Psychic Mortification<2> -- At 8th level, the alienist's mind has become
          so scorched by outer horrors that mortal traumas no longer have the ability
          to damage it -- her Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are sustained at 5
          points each.\n
           __*_<7>Sanity-Blasting Spellcasting<2> -- At 9th level, the alienist's
           methods of spellcasting are so otherworldly and alien that any creature
           of CR 7 or lower who sees her cast a spell takes 1d2 points of Wisdom
           damage.\n
           __*_<7>Distant Apotheosis<2> -- At 10th level, the alienist becomes a
           fundamentally alien creature herself, developing trememdously increased
           physical resistance. She gains immunity to critical hits, no longer needs
           to breathe or eat and does not age.\n\n 

           <10>SPELL LIST<2>\n
           <15>__1st level -- <1> grease, obscurement, spiritwrack, true strike.\n
           <15>__2nd level -- <1> hypnotic pattern, revealed lore, stinking cloud, 
           touch of idiocy.\n
           <15>__3rd level -- <1> animate shadows, explosive runes, lorecall.\n
           <15>__4th level -- <1> confusion, evard's black tentacles, phantasmal 
           killer, premonition.\n
           <15>__5th level -- <1> banishment, distance distortion, dream, nightmare,
           open the third eye.

      <2>\n__The Guild of Assassins has an old and arcane history on Theyra, having existed
      in some recognizable form for over two millenia, and having pursued an ageless
      vendetta with the Thieves. More than simply murderers, Assassins are mystical slayers
      devoted to a secret order and famed to be able to reach even the most protected
      targets in even the most remote locations. There is an aristocracy to the Assassin,
      a sense of entitlement and elitism. Assassins tend to believe their order fulfills an
      important philosophical purpose, maintaining political and social balance by
      ensuring that decadant kings and degenerate nobles are not able to place themselves
      beyond retribution as a function of their station. Of course, in practice, the
      Assassins are killers for profit, and there is very little that qualifies as 
      redeeming qualities within their guild.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The Assassin is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become an Assassin, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Disguise +10, Poison Use +10, Hide in
      Shadows +7, Move Silently +7.\n
      __*_<7>Alignment<2> -- Assassins cannot be of Good alignment.\n
            
      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the Assassin are Alchemy, Appraise,
      Balance, Bluff, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Find Weakness,
      Gather Information, Handle Device, Hide in Shadows, Intimidate, 
      Intuition, Jump, Listen, Lockpicking, Move Silently, Poison Use,
      Spot, Swim and Tumble. 
      
      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Assassins gain proficiency with crossbows
      and light weapons.\n      
      __*_<7>Sneak Attack<2> -- Assassins can make use of Sneak Attacks in
      the same manner a Rogue does; they gain +1d6 Sneak Attack damage
      every odd level. Levels of this ability from Assassin, Rogue and any
      other class stack.\n
      __*_<7>Death Attack<2> -- An assassin who has had time to study her
      target (in game terms, being out of combat long enough to be considered
      Exploring rather than Fighting) and attacks that target by complete 
      surprise in a situation where the target cannot perceive the Assassin, 
      is considered to have made a death attack and has a chance to slay that 
      target outright. A death attack can only be made against a target within
      30 feet; greater distance negates the needed precision.\n
      __The victim of a death attack must make a Fortitude saving throw
      against a DC of 10 + the Assassin's class level + the Assassin's
      Intelligence modifier; failure means they are slain instantly. If
      they succeed at this saving throw, they are still subject to damage
      from the attack, which may kill them anyway.\n
      __*_<7>Spells<2> -- Assassins practice magic and are capable of
      casting Arcane spells from a tiny subset of the mage list. They have
      their own spellbooks, though in a pinch they can use normal arcane
      spellbooks for spellcasting as well.\n
      __*_<7>Skill Mastery<2> -- Assassins gain a +1 competance bonus to
      Disguise and Poison Use for every Assassin class level.\n
      __*_<7>Uncanny Dodge<2> -- Assassins gain this ability at the same
      rate that Rogues do, and a character's Rogue and Assassin levels
      stack to determine her effective Rogue level for the purposes of
      Uncanny Dodge.

      \n\n<10>SPELL LIST<2>\n
      <15>__1st level -- <1>change self, convulsion, expeditious retreat,
      magic weapon, obscurement, passwall, read magic, shield, sleep,

      darkness, deep slumber, displacement, gaseous form, greater magic
      weapon, illusory stance, nondetection.\n

      <2>__It's uncommon in the extreme for free-willed, intelligent living beings to
      willingly and knowingly devote themselves to the ideal of evil. Oh, certainly,
      Theyra is well stocked with murderers, tyrants and all manner of despicable
      corruption -- but at the end of the day, the vast majority of Evil characters
      commit their amoralities for false ideology or personal profit, and then turn
      around and rationalize their acts as best as they can within their own value
      systems. The blackguard, however, is the exception to this rule.\n
      __A blackguard is fully cognisant of the objective quality of good and evil,
      and in that context has willfully and knowingly embraced evil, determined to
      live up to the image of everything unholy and profane. This deviant psychology
      includes a willful drive to cultivate and nurture sociopathy and to engage in
      all manner of wicked acts simply because their are so. The blackguard may be 
      superficially motivated by powerlust, bigotry, guilt or any other common drive,
      but in the end if is a kind of spiritual perversity, a love of evil, that drives
      them to do the things that they do. They know what they are, and they enjoy it.\n
      __No mainstream religion on Theyra tolerates blackguards. Despite his objective
      alignment, Erich will expend truly significant military force to hunt down and
      destroy a blackguard -- or anyone suspected or accused of being one -- often
      killing hundreds of innocents in the process. Neither does the priesthood of Xel 
      tolerate them, fearing that their perversity and theatric nature would draw too
      much of the wrong kind of attention down on their ranks. A few blackguards
      worship Zurvash, but the majority serve either the Multitude or the archdevils
      and demon princes of the Lower Planes directly.
      
      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The blackguard is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class for
      all characters. In order to become a blackguard, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Alignment<2> -- Obviously, any character who wishes to become a
      blackguard must be utterly Evil. Changing to a non-evil alignment causes
      all of the blackguard's supernatural class features to become inaccessable.\n
      __*_<7>Base Attack Bonus<2> -- An aspirant must have a BAB of at least +6
      in one category.\n
      __*_<7>Skills<2> -- A character must be a creature of blood, terror and
      brutality even before becoming a blackguard, possessed of an Intimidate
      score of +12 or higher. He must also be knowledgable in the ways of the
      Lower Planes in order to attract a patron, with a Knowledge (Infernal)
      rating of +10 or higher.\n
      __*_<7>Religion<2> -- Very few gods will tolerate a blackguard as a 
      follower. In addition to gods who do not tolerate Evil followers in
      general, Xel, Erich, Immotian and Khasrach will not accept blackguards
      among their worshippers.

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the blackguard are Craft, Find Weakness,
      Intimidate, Knowledge (Infernal), Knowledge (Theology), Knowledge 
      (Planes), Poison Use and Ride. 

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The blackguard is proficient with blades,
      impact weapons, polearms and spears, and with all classes of armour.\n
      __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- Blackguards practice certain diabolical magic.
      They gain one caster level for every even blackguard level, and choose
      their spells from the special blackguard list. Blackguards cast spells
      just like priests do, being able to cast in any armour freely, but
      needing to have a holy symbol equipped (if they have a god).\n
      __*_<7>Unholy Grace<2> -- Just as a paladin does, a blackguard may add
      his Charisma bonus to all of his saving throws as a grace bonus.\n
      __*_<7>Sense Light<2> -- Starting at 1st level, a blackguard can use
      <9>detect good<2> as an innate spell-like ability at will.\n
      __*_<7>Smite Good<2> -- A blackguard can smite Good-aligned creatures.
      When she perform the Great Blow maneuver against a Good creature, a
      blackguard adds her Charisma bonus to the attack roll and gains a
      bonus to the damage roll equal to her blackguard class level.\n
      __*_<7>Command Undead<2> -- Starting at 3rd level, a blackguard can
      rebuke or command undead exactly as an evil priest of 1st level does.
      Every additional blackguard level increases this effective level by
      one.\n
      __*_<7>Aura of Despair<2> -- Starting at 4th level, a blackguard
      projects an aura of crushing despair around himself, not unlike that
      of a mummy. The aura reaches out to a radius of 20 feet around the
      blackguard; all who enter it and are not evil or immune to fear
      suffer a -2 morale penalty to all rolls.\n
      __*_<7>Sneak Attack<2> -- A blackguard gains a sneak attack just
      like a rogue's, starting at 5th level. Blackguard levels stack with
      rogue, assasin or any similar levels for determining the total level
      of this ability a blackguard possesses.\n
      __*_<7>Fiendish Servant<2> -- Starting at 5th level, a blackguard
      can summon an imp or quasit, as suits his alignment, who will serve
      him loyally. The creature remains until dismissed, and if slain can
      be summoned anew the next day.

      \n\n<10>SPELL LIST<2>\n
      <15>__1st level -- <1>bane, cause fear, convulsion, cure light wounds, 
      doom, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, malignance, mount, pain touch,
      protection from good, spiritwrack.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The bladesinger is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become a bladesinger, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Race<2> -- Only elves (not drow) may become bladesingers.\n
      __*_<7>BAB<2> -- Melee BAB +4.\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Perform +15.\n
      __*_<7>Known Spells<2> -- You must know the <9>cat's grace<2> spell;
      having it as an innate spell-like ability does not qualify.\n 
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Expertise, Quicken Spell, Weapon Finesse.
      		
      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the bladesinger are Athletics, Balance, 
      Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Jump, Knowledge (all), Listen, Perform 
      and Tumble.

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Bladesingers are proficient with the long
      sword.\n
      __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- Bladesingers cast spells just as bards do,
      being able to cast in light armour and not requiring spellbooks. They
      cast spells from the bladesinger spell list and receive one caster
      level for every even bladesinger level. They can also continue to
      learn spells from whatever casting class qualified them to be a
      bladesinger, though they must follow the restrictions of that class
      in casting those spells -- a warrior/mage/bladesinger, for example,
      cannot wear armour and must use spellbooks when casting spells on the
      mage list but not on the bladesinger list.\n
      __*_<7>Acrobatic Fighting<2> -- Bladesingers receive a level of the
      Acrobatic Fighting ability (as described under the duelist prestige
      class) at every odd bladesinger level, starting at 3rd. Levels of
      this ability received from bladesinger and duelist stack.\n
      __*_<7>Bladesong Style<2> -- Starting at 1st level, a bladesinger
      receives a dodge bonus to her defense class equal to the lower of 
      her Intelligence bonus or her total levels in the bladesong ability, 
      when wielding a rapier or long sword in her weapon hand and
      nothing in her ready hand. Every even level of bladesong
      also grants her a +5~ bonus to attack speed when she is
      so equipped.\n
      __At 3rd level, she gains a +4 bonus to Perform and
      Concentration when wielding a rapier or long sword in her
      weapon hand and nothing in her ready hand.\n
      __At 6th level, she no longer requires verbal components to
      cast bladesinger spells when she is wielding a rapier or
      long sword in her weapon hand and nothing in her ready
      hand.\n
      __At 9th level, she is able to use blade gestures to aid
      in the rapid casting of spells, and thus subtracts half
      (round up) of her weapon's enchantment bonus from the
      metamagic cost of the Quicken Spell feat.\n\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The celestial initiate is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class

      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Knowledge (Theology) +12.\n
      __*_<7>Alignment<2> -- Zealously Good (or zealously lawful for Immotian).\n
      __*_<7>Religion<2> -- You must worship, and have gained 6 blessings from,

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Celestial initiates gain proficiency with
      long blades, all types of armour and shields.\n
      __*_<7>Smite Evil<2> -- The celestial initiate gains the ability to
      smite evil just as a paladin does. Levels of this ability from
      paladin and celestial initiate stack.\n
      __*_<7>Resist Poison<2> -- At 1st level, the celestial initiate
      receives a +4 bonus to saving throws versus poison. At 7th level,
      she becomes immune to poison.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Resistances<2> -- At 2nd level, the celestial
      initiate gains resistances to two types of elemental damage, based
      on her alignment and the type of celestial she is transforming
      into: lawful archons resist electricity and acid, neutral guardinals
      resist fire and cold and chaotic eladrins resist fire and necromantic
      damage. These resistances begin at 5 and increase by +3 for every
      celestial initiate level thereafter.\n
      __*_<7>Spell-Like Abilities<2> -- At 1st level, the celestial
      initiate gains the ability to use <9>call light<2> as an innate
      spell-like ability.\n    
      __*_<7>Ability Increases<2> -- At 4th level, the celestial initiate
      receives a +2 sacred bonus to Wisdom and Charisma; this bonus  
      increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 at 10th level.\n
      __*_<7>Wings<2> -- At 5th level, the celestial initiate grows a
      vestigal pair of feathery white wings that allow her to control
      her descent, giving her a constant <9>feather fall<2> effect. At
      6th level, these wings are fully developed and she may now fly
      at her full normal movement rate. At 8th level, she gains a 150%
      inherant bonus to her flying movement rate.\n
      __*_<7>Protective Aura<2> -- At 3rd level, a celestial initiate 
      gains the benefit of a constantly active <9>magic circle vs. evil<2> 
      effect. At 9th level, this strengthens to duplicate the full effect
      of a celestial's protective aura: the area of effect and penalty of
      the circle is doubled, and it also duplicates the effects of a
      <9>globe of invulnerability<2>, preventing the casting of
      spells of 5th level or lower by anyone other than the celestial
      initiate.\n
      __*_<7>Sharp Senses<2> -- The celestial initiate's senses sharpen
      starting at level 5, granting her two levels of the Sharp Senses
      ability (possessed by elves); levels of this ability gained from
      being an elf and a celestial initiate stack. The initiate gains
      another two levels of Sharp Senses at level 10.\n

      these just like normal potions with the Quaff command. The primary advantage
      of blood infusions is that they take only five segments to permeate, versus
      the 30 segments normally used to drink a potion. Additionally, when the
      crimson adept reaches 10th level, the effects of all blood infusions are
      automatically maximized.\n
      __*_<7>Thicker than Water<2> -- The crimson adept learns to transmute her
      blood at 3rd level, diffussing and thickening it to make her more resistant
      to injury. She becomes immune to bleeding and gains a +2 magic bonus to her
      constitution, as well as a resistance of 5 to slashing damage. At 5th level,
      these bonuses increase to +4 Con and 7 resistance, and at 9th, +6 Con and
      9 resistance.\n
      __*_<7>Blood Whip<2> -- At 3rd level, the crimson adept gains the ability
      to slit his wrist and emit a stream of blood that supernaturally congeals
      into a razor-sharp liquid whip. This weapon acts as a keen weakening whip
      with an enchantment bonus equal to half the user's crimson adept class
      level (round down), but creating it costs her 3d6 hit points.\n
      __*_<7>Wounding Magic<2> -- Whenever a crimson adept of 4th level or higher
      inflicts non-elemental, non-aligned spell damage on a target (such as from 
      <9>magic missile<2>, <9>thornwrack<2>, <9>ring of blades<2>, <9>glyph of
      warding<2>, etc.), the target must make an additional Fortitude save (DC
      15 + crimson adept class level) or bleed for 1 additional point of damage
      for the next 2d6 rounds.\n
      __*_<7>Steal Life<2> -- The crimson adept is now able to regain magical
      energy through the death of creatures with blood; every such creature she
      kills restores to her half its Challenge Rating in mana points.\n
      __*_<7>Animate Blood<2> -- At the cost of 3 fatigue points, the crimson
      adept can animate the blood within any other creature, causing that
      creature to suffer [crimson adept level]d8 points of untyped damage as 
      their blood attempts to tear free of their body; a Fortitude saving
      throw halves the damage. If this effect kills the victim, a blood elemental
      (similar to a water elemental) is created to serve the caster for the
      remainder of the day, with its size being dependant upon the victim's
      Challenge Rating.\n

      <2>\n__[ Flavour Text ]

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The duelist is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become a duelist, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>BAB<2> -- Melee BAB +3.\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Tumble +10.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Expertise, Mobility, Weapon Finesse.
            
      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the duelist are Appraise, Athletics, Balance, 
      Bluff, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Listen, Perform and Tumble.

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Duelists gain proficiency with the daggers
      and short blades weapon groups, and with the long sword.\n
      __*_<7>Canny Defense<2> -- Starting at 1st level, duelists add the
      lower of their duelist level or their primary Intelligence modifier
      as an insight bonus to their armour class, when wearing medium or
      lighter armour. Note that as an insight bonus, this does not stack 
      with Zen Defense.\n
        [ Implementation note: use this as an excuse to do EV_CALC_VALUES
      and export AddBonus as an IncursionScript function -- it's about
      time! ]\n
      __*_<7>Scoundrel's Charm<2> -- Duelists receive the Alluring feat
      as a bonus feat at 2nd level.\n
      __*_<7>Acrobatic Fighting<2> -- This ability grants a number of
      related benefits to a duelist, starting at 2nd level. Its benefits
      apply only when a character is wearing light or no armour, and is
      lightly encombered or less. Levels of this ability gained from
      duelist and bladesinger.\n
      __<3>Grace:<2> At 2nd level, the duelist receives a +2 bonus to
      reflex saving throws, and to the skills Athletics, Balance, Jump and Tumble,
      provided she meets the conditions described above. This bonus increases 
      by +1 for every three further acrobatic fighting levels -- +3 at 5th, 
      +4 at 8th, etc.\n
      __<3>Acrobatic Charge:<2> At 3rd level, the duelist may perform an
      acrobatic charge. This allows her to charge and tumble at the same
      time, and when she does, her charge bonus increases by +1.\n
      __<3>Enhanced Mobility:<2> Starting at 4th level, the duelist gains
      a +1 bonus to Defense Class against attacks of opportunity; this
      bonus stacks with the one granted from the Mobility feat, and
      increases by +1 for every further level of acrobatic fighting from
      any source.\n
      __<3>Scenery is Power:<2> Starting at 5th level, the duelist gains
      a peerless ability to make use of her enviornment and objects around
      her when fighting. She gains a stunt bonus to hit and damage based on the
      terrain and objects around her. For example, standing in the same 
      square with a chest might give her +1/+1 (she could stand atop it for 
      a height advantage, kick it at an opponent, position it between her 
      and her opponent to direct the opponent's advance, etc.) Other
      features that can be used effectively in combat include doors, mud,
      water, forges, other furnature, hanging vines, etc.\n
      __Different types of scenery increase the creative stunts a character
      with this ability is capable of, and thus increase the bonuses granted,
      but a single type of scenery doesn't increase in bonus regardless of
      how much of it there is.\n
      __<3>Elaborate Parry:<2> A character with 5 levels of acrobatic fighting
      (such as a 6th-level duelist) finds that the benefits gained fron fighting
      defensively are doubled, while the penalties remain unchanged, provided
      that she is wielding a short blade or long sword as her primary weapon.\n
      __<3>Mantis Leap:<2> A character with 6 levels of acrobatic fighting is
      treated as possessing the Mantis Leap feat when she is wielding a short
      blade or long sword and wearing light or no armour.\n 
      __<3>Free Tumble:<2> With 8 levels of acrobatic fighting (i.e., a 9th-level
      duelist), the character gains the ability to use the Tumble skill without
      paying fatigue points. She may tumble for free once per day per two levels
      of acrobatic fighting.\n
      __*_<7>Rapier Wit<2> -- Duelists are infamous for using cutting insults
      and clever repartee to rattle their opponents, allowing them to land
      especially telling blows. Starting at 4th level, on 1 in 5 attacks
      against a sapient opponent using a dagger, short blade or long sword, 
      the duelist makes a Bluff check, which the target opposes with a
      Concentration check. If the duelist's check is higher, she adds half her
      margin of success to the damage of the attack, to a maximum of twice
      her primary Charisma modifier.\n
      __When the duelist reaches 7th level, this ability functions on 1 in 4
      attacks; at 10th, it functions on 1 in 3. This ability does not function
      if either attacker or victim is in a region of magical silence.\n
      __*_<7>Flashing Blade<2> -- The duelist receives Deflect Arrows as
      a conditional bonus feat at 5th level and Deflect Magic as a conditional
      bonus feat at 8th level. The character is treated as having these
      feats only when wielding a magical short blade or long sword one-
      handed in her weapon hand with which her attack speed is 250~ or
      higher, and wearing light or no armour.\n 
      __*_<7>Luck of the Daring<2> -- The duelist receives the Unearthly
      Luck ability at 6th level, allowing her to add her primary Luck
      modifier to all saving throws. Halfling duelists, who already have
      this ability from their race, receive two bonus feats from the
      warrior feat list instead.

      <2>\n__Beyond even the priesthood of Ekliazeh, the dwarves as a race have
      always held a deep spiritual reverance for elemental earth. Their mythology
      is filled with animistic tales of heroes who spoke to the very stone, and
      were able to work miracles through communion with it. These rare dwarves
      occupy a niche vaguely similar to a saint -- their abilities are unquestionably
      sacred, yet they also set them outside of traditional society.\n
      __Very few dwarves have the potential to awaken the Earthsong within themselves.
      A potential Earthsinger must have some exposure to supernatural music, usually
      via bardic training, but the physical demands of the tradition mean that most
      aspirants are warrior-craftsmen with only a casual experimentation in the bardic
      arts. The stone demands champions who are as strong and enduring as it is, and
      also demands that they be master stoneworkers. For every thousand dwarves who
      aspires to learn the mystical Earthsong, only one or two manage to meet all of
      the requisites to become Earthsingers.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The Earthsinger is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class for
      all characters. In order to become an Earthsinger, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Race<2> -- All known Earthsingers are dwarves. An aspirant must be
      a dwarf, or a member of a race with similarly strong bonds to the earth,
      such as a rock gnome or pech.\n
      __*_<7>Base Attack Bonus<2> -- An aspirant must have a melee BAB of +5.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Endurance, Hardiness.\n
      __*_<7>Skills<2> -- A successful aspirant must be a master stonecutter
      with a Crafts skill of 15+.\n
      __*_<7>Class Abilities<2> -- An aspirant must have the Bardic Music ability.\n
      __*_<7>Religion<2> -- An aspirant must either worship Ekliazeh (or another
      god who grants the Earth domain), or forsake gods entirely and devote himself
      utterly to the worship of elemental earth.

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the Earthsinger are Athletics, Balance, Climb, 
      Concentration, Craft, Heal, Knowledge (Planes), Listen, Mining,
      Perform, Search and Spot. 

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The Earthsinger gains no weapon or armour
      proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Stonebody<2> -- As an Earthsinger becomes closer and closer
      to the spiritual nature of elemental earth, her skin begins to take
      on a rocky texture and grows harder and harder. Every odd level of
      this class gives the Earthsinger a +1 natural armour bonus.\n 
      __*_<7>Earth Magic<2> -- By speaking to the stone itself using the
      Earthsong, the singer can learn from it, shape it, animate it and
      even take on its properties. In game terms, the character gains a
      number of spell-like abilities as she advances in this class, in
      the following order: <9>stone tell<2>, <9>soften stone<2>, <9>meld
      into stone<2>, <9>spike stones<9>, <9>earthmaw<2>, <9>wall of stone<2>,
      <9>transmute rock to mud<2>, <9>stoneskin<2>, <9>animate rock<2>,
      <9>conjure earth elemental<2>, <9>transmute flesh to stone<2> and
      <9>elemental aura<2> (the earth version only).\n
      __*_<7>Geomancy<2> -- Starting at 3rd level, a Earthsinger can tap
      into the primal energies of the earth in order to replenish her own
      magical energies. By spending two fatigue points, she can instantly
      regain 5d12 points of mana. At 7th level, the Earthsinger gains a
      greater facility with this ability, and it then costs her only one
      fatigue point.\n
      __*_<7>Grounded Stance<2> -- An Earthsinger is able to draw upon
      the power of the earth in order to enhance the force of her blows
      in melee or unarmed combat. Provided that her feet are touching
      the ground -- she is not levitating, ethereal or standing on 
      non-earthen terrain, and she is not wearing magical boots -- she
      may add her Earthsinger level to the damage of her melee or
      unarmed attacks.

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The elementalist is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. When you attempt entry into the class, you must
      choose one of the four classical elements (earth, air, fire or water)
      to focus on. Once you have gained your first elementalist level, this
      choice cannot be changed. In order to become an elementalist, you must 
      have:\n
      __*_<7>Spells<2> -- Eight levels of spells (for example, 1 3rd level and
      two 2nd level) with the descriptor of your chosen element. Characters
      who worship a god who grants the appropriate elemental domain (Immotian,
      Ekliazeh, Sabine or Kysul), or who have a matching elemental affinity as
      a racial ability, only need six levels of appropriate spells.\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Knowledge (Planes) +12.\n
      __*_<7>Mentorship<2> -- You must have an intelligent creature of at least
      CR 3 in your party that has the appropriate elemental subtype.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Empower Spell, Heighten Spell.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the elementalist are Concentration, Decipher Script, 
      Knowledge (all), Metamagic, Spellcraft and Use Magic. Additionally, you
      gain some additional class skills based on your chosen element: Earth --
      Craft, Mining and Wilderness Lore; Air -- Jump, Listen and Tumble; Fire --
      Athletics and Craft, and Water -- Alchemy, Escape Artist and Swim.\n 

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Elementalists gain no new proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- Elementalists gain access to all wizard,
      priest and druid spells with their chosen elemental descriptor, at a
      rate of one spell level per elementalist level. They also continue to
      advance the spell access of whatever other spellcasting class they
      have; if they have more than one, one is chosen to advance in this
      order of priority: druid, mage, priest, ranger or bard. Elementalists
      can cast their newly accessable spells with the same rules the class
      whose spell access is still advancing has. In other words, priest-
      elementalists need holy symbols to use their elemental spells, but
      can cast in heavy armour; druid elementalists cannot cast elemental
      spells in metal armour, etc. The one exception is mage/elementalists,
      who do not need spellbooks for their elemental spells.\n
      __Elementalists gain a new caster level at every elementalist level
      except 1st and 5th.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Specialist<2> -- An elementalist gains the same benefits
      as a specialist mage when using spells with her elemental descriptor
      -- a +25~ chance of spell success, correspondingly reduced mana cost
      and so forth. These benefits stack with existing specialist benefits
      for a mage-elementalist. Spells without the elemental descriptor are
      unaltered by this ability.\n
      __The elementalist also increases her effective caster level when
      using these spells by +2 at 1st and 5th levels. At 6th level, the
      DC of all spells with the appropriate descriptor increases by +2,
      just as with the School Focus feat, but for the element instead of
      a school.\n
      __There is a penalty to this power. When casting spells that do
      not have her chosen elemental descriptor, the spell inflicts only
      75~ of the damage, or has 75~ of its normal numerical magnitude.
      A mage-elementalist also loses the special advantage associated with
      her previous school specialization, such as a necromancer's increased
      ability to control undead, a weaver's controlled teleports or an 
      evoker's increased fatigue.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Summons<2> -- When using a Summon Nature's Ally,
      Monster Summoning or Holy Summoning spell, elementalists always
      call creatures with the appropriate elemental subtype. This applies
      to all such spells effective at the 1st elementalist level.\n
      __Further, any animal companion or sacred mount you summon gains
      the aqueous, flame, earthen or gaseous template, as appropriate.\n 
      __*_<7>Elemental Dependency<2> -- Elementalists acquire a certain
      weakness based on their chosen element, starting at 1st level. Fire
      elementalists cannot cast spells or use magical items with the Water
      descriptor, and suffer untyped hit point damage from soaking, in
      addition to the normal effects. Water elementalists cannot use spells
      with the Fire descriptor, and suffer double damage from fire effects
      and magic. They are not injured by cold damage, but instead are
      <9>slow<2>ed for one round for every hit point of damage they would
      have taken.\n
      __Earth elementalists suffer a -2 penalty to hit, damage and saves, and 
      1 1/2 times mana cost for all spells, when they are not in direct physical 
      contact with earth or stone -- for example, when flying, levitating, climbing
      in trees, wearing boots or mounted. Air elementalists suffer a similar penalty 
      whenever they are not airbourne, or when they are grappled.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Boost<2> -- Elementalists receive a magic bonus to two
      attributes as they advance. This bonus is +1/+0 at 2nd level, +1/+1 at
      4th level, +2/+2 at 7th level and +3/+3 at 10th level. The attributes are
      Strength and Constitution for earth elementalists, Dexterity and Luck for
      air elementalists, Charisma and Intelligence for fire elementalists and
      Wisdom and Dexterity for water elementalists.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Defense<2> -- Elementalists also gain certain defensive
      abilities based on their close connection to their chosen element. Earth
      elementalists add their elementalist level as a bonus to saving throws
      versus petrification, and gain the Toughness feat (or one of Endurance,
      Living Wall or Great Fortitude if they already have all the precursors)
      at 5th and immunity to critical hits at 8th. Air elementalists move like
      the wind itself, gaining Uncanny Dodge as a rogue of their elementalist
      level, Evasion at 5th and Improved Evasion at 8th.\n 
      __Fire elementalists gain fire resistance equal to three times their
      elementalist level, until they receive complete immunity to fire at
      8th level. Water elementalists move sinuously, their bodies flowing
      like water -- they add their elementalist level to their Swim skill
      rating, gain the ability to breathe water at 5th level and a +4 magic
      bonus to their DC at 8th level.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Brand<2> -- Any magical weapon wielded by an elementalist
      of 3rd level or higher gains a magical quality for as long as it remains
      in the elementalist's hands at no cost: flaming for fire elementalists,
      shifting for water elementalists, stunning for earth elementalists and
      seeking for air elementalists.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Covenant<2> -- Starting at 9th level, creatures with the
      appropriate elemental subtype are automatically neutral to the elementalist,
      and will not attack her unless she provokes them.\n
      __*_<7>Elemental Body<2> -- At 10th level, the elementalist gains the
      innate spell-like ability to polymorph into a large elemental of the
      appropriate type. This costs 2 fatigue and lasts for 10 turns. When
      she uses this special form of polymorph, all of her equipment merges 
      into her new form.

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The inquisitor is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become an inquisitor, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Intimidate +12.\n
      __*_<7>Alignment<2> -- Zealously Lawful.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Detective.\n
      __*_<7>Abilities<2> -- You must be able to turn undead as a 5th-level
      priest.\n
      __*_<7>Religion<2> -- You must worship Immotian, and have attained at
      least four blessings from him. 

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the inquisitor are Appraise, Bluff, Concentration,
      Decipher Script, Diplomacy, Disguise, Escape Artist, Find Weakness,
      Gather Information, Intimidate, Knowledge (all), Listen, Lockpicking,
      Metamagic, Poison Use, Search, Spellcraft and Spot.

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Inquisitors gain proficiency with light
      weapons and daggers.\n
      __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- At every level save for 1st and 3rd, the
      inquisitor gains a spellcasting chart level. The inquisitor also
      treats inquisitor levels as if they were priest levels for the purpose
      of improving her access to the priest spell list. Inquisitors also
      have their own spell list, which they receive access to at one
      spell level per inquisitor level.\n
      __The inquisitor does not gain new domain spells or improve the
      abilities granted by domains for her inquisitor levels, however.\n
      __*_<7>Turn Undead<2> -- The inquisitor gains one level of the turn
      undead ability for every inquisitor class level; this stacks with
      the levels gained from being a priest or paladin.\n
      __*_<7>Zealous Mettle<2> -- The inquisitor learns to trust in zeal
      and endurance alone to protect them. When unarmoured, she adds a
      sacred bonus to all of her saving throws equal to her inquisitor
      class level. At 9th level she receives Toughness as a bonus feat
      as long as she is unarmoured; at 10th level, she receives Resilience
      likewise.\n
      __*_<7>Grim Reputation<2> -- The agents of the Purified Office of the
      Sacred Inquisition are rightly feared for their political power and
      methods of torture; they in turn learn to exloit fear as a tactical
      advantage, adding their inquisitor class level to their Intimidate
      skill as an insight bonus.\n
      __*_<7>Detect Corruption<2> -- Inquisitors are trained to root out
      criminal behaviour, discerning heretics and dissidents. Starting at
      1st level, they gain <9>detect corruption<2> as an innate spell-like
      ability; this functions as <9>detect evil<2>, save that it detects
      both evil and chaotic creatures, and does not reveal those who have
      Immotian's favour regardless of alignment.\n
      __*_<7>Smite Corruption<2> -- An inquisitor can smite corrupt creatures
      just as a paladin smites evil creatures. Additionally, the inquisition
      thrives on mob justice; for every allied creature the inquisitor has
      with her, her effective level increases by one for smiting purposes.
      If a paladin/inquisitor smites a creature both evil and corrupt, the
      damage bonuses stack, but the Charisma bonus to hit is added only
      once.\n
      __*_<7>Purge Magic<2> -- Inquisitors, like all of Immotian's clergy,
      view arcane magic as unclean; they are taught special methods of
      purging magical influences from an area, person or object, and receive
      a +1 bonus to caster level checks for <9>dispel magic<2> and related
      efffect at 2nd level, +1 for every inquisitor level thereafter.\n
      __*_<7>Blessed Tithe<2> -- At its root, the inquisition exists not
      to defend light and purity, or even to uphold dogma and suppress
      other religions, but to provide a legal framework for the Church of
      Immotian to sieze the land and wealth of social malcontents and
      minorities, thereby maintaining the hegemony of the Church of Immotian 
      within Theryan society. Inquisitors thus have as a primary goal the
      procurement of gold for the church, which they can translocate to
      the High Temple of the Pure Flame by offering it on an altar to
      Immotian.\n
      __Immotian offers a powerful incentive to those inquisitors who 
      bring wealth to the church. Starting at 3rd level, an inquisitor
      can offer coins as a sacrifice to Immotian. While this does not
      increase divine favour -- the coins are not a 'true' sacrifice --
      the inquisitor does receive 1 experience point for every 25 gold
      pieces worth of riches offered in this manner.\n 
      __Using this ability funds an evil organization and is therefore
      an evil act.\n
      __*_<7>Purified Sight<2> -- Starting at 4th level, the inquisitor
      is innately able to see invisible creatures.\n
      __*_<7>Gentle Inquiry<2> -- Starting at 5th level, the inquisitor 
      is able to inflict agony with a simple touch., and may use the
      <9>pain touch<2> spell (described under domain spells) as an 
      innate spell-like ability. At 7th level, she may use <9>burning
      blood<2> likewise.\n
      __*_<7>Incorruptable<2> -- Immotian blesses his inquisitors
      personally, rendering them incorruptable (for some definitions
      of the term, anyway). Starting at 6th level, they are immune
      to charm effects; at 8th level, they become immune to all
      compulsions.\n

      <10>SPELL LIST<2>\n
      <15>__1st level -- <1> ethereal blade, spiritwrack.\n
      <15>__2nd level -- <1> animate rope, bladethirst, divine sacrifice,

      <2>\n__While many mages are academics to some extent, the Loremasters are an order
      that places the seeking of knowledge above all other goals. These wise wizards are
      widely sought after by universities as teachers, and by royal courts and military
      camps as advisers and viziers. Despite this demand, however, Loremasters tend to
      be isolationistic, living cloistered lives in distant towers or establishing sacred
      monastaries in the desert in which to preserve vast stores of ancient books.\n

      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- 4 Knowledge skills at +10.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Scribe Scroll.\n
      __*_<7>Spells<2> -- 10 levels of known Divination spells (i.e., 2 3rd-level
      spells and 2 2nd-level spells).\n
      __*_<7>Alignment<2> -- You must have a neutral component in your alignment.   

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the Loremaster are Alchemy, Appraise, Craft, Concentration, Decipher
      Script, Heal, Illusioncraft, Intuition, Knowledge (all), Metamagic, Seneschal,

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The Loremaster gains no weapon or armour
      proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Spellcasting<2> -- The Loremaster gains one spellcasting level for every
      Loremaster level after the 1st. Additionally, she continues to gain access to new
      spells from her original spellcasting class as if every Loremaster level was a
      level in that class. If she has more than one spellcasting class, she gains new
      spell access for mage as a priority if she has that, then bard, then druid, then
      priest, then ranger, then paladin.\n
      __*_<7>Legend Lore<2> -- Loremasters gain -- or continue to advance in -- the 
      Legend Lore ability, gaining one level of such for every Loremaster level.\n
      __*_<7>Ancient Books<2> -- At 2nd, 4th and 8th levels, the constant knowledge-seeking
      and research of a Loremaster pays off and they 'discover' a new spellbook hidden away 
      somewhere near them.\n
      __*_<7>Knowledge<2> -- Loremasters gain three bonus skill points that can be devoted
      only to Knowledge skills with every class level.\n 
      __*_<7>Forewarning<2> -- Loremasters are able to sense and predict attacks before
      they occur, and gain a +1 insight bonus to DC every even Loremaster level.\n 
      __*_<7>Studious Development<2> -- Loremasters gain a +1 competance bonus to their
      Intelligence at every odd Loremaster level.\n 
      __*_<7>Secrets<2> -- As Loremasters advance in level, they gain certain exceptional
      abilities as a result of the ancient mysticism they study:\n
      __At 1st level, Loremasters gain the inherant ability to see invisible.\n
      __At 3th level, Loremasters gain the Fatesense ability, allowing them to instantly
      discern whether a given item is cursed or blessed.\n
      __At 5th level, Loremasters gain an exceptional insight into magical books, and
      gain an extra +1d2 attribute points from any tome they read.\n

      spell-like ability.\n
      __At 7th level, Loremasters gain constant <9>true seeing<2>.\n

      innate spell-like ability.

      <2>\n\tThe Master Archer is a practicioner of a secretive but potent archery-based
      martial art, a philosophical ideal that seeks to meld meditation, archery and
      athleticism into a single, perfected whole. The practice is particulairly common
      among elves, but members of other races have on rare occasions been initiated into
      the Master Archer class as well.\n
      
      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The Master Archer is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class for
      all characters. In order to become a Master Archer, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Concentration +10.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, Zen Archery, Weapon
      Focus (long bow or short bow).\n
      __*_<7>Base Attack<2> -- Initiates must have a Base Attack Bonus of +5 in
      the archery category.\n
      __*_<7>Special<2> -- Initiates must show exceptional aptitude for the art
      in the form of a Wisdom score of 17+; this requirement is waived for elves,
      who have an easier time finding a teacher.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the Master Archer are Athletics, Balance, Climb, 
      Concentration, Craft, Find Weakness, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot
      and Wilderness Lore.
      
      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The Master Archer gains no weapon or armour
      proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Arrowstorm<2> -- The primary ability of the Master Archer is to fire
      arrows at a truly staggering rate as a result of their transcendent focus and
      discipline. Every Master Archer level taken adds a +5%% bonus to attack speed
      in archery.\n
      __*_<7>Blindsight<2> -- Starting at 6th level, the Master Archer gains the
      Blindsight ability as a result of her transcendant focus and meditation; this
      ability has a range of 30 feet at 6th, plus 10 feet for every Master Archer
      level thereafter.\n
      __*_<7>Ranged Sneak Attack<2> -- The Master Archer is able to strike unprepared
      foes with lethal shots for extra damage. This functions exactly like a Rogue's
      Sneak Attack ability, but can only be performed with a long bow or short bow.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- The Master Archer gains the Defensive Shot feat at 2nd level
      and the Precise Shot feat at 8th; if she already has either of these feats, she
      can choose any other feat upon attaining these levels instead.\n
      __*_<7>Opportune Shot<2> -- Starting at 4th level, whenever a creature hostile 
      to the Master Archer is struck as an attack of opportunity by someone other than
      the archer within 60 feet of the archer, and the archer has a clear line of fire
      to that creature, she may take an immediate, single shot against the creature
      that suffered an attack of opportunity.\n
      __*_<7>Banked Shot<2> -- Upon reaching 10th level, the master archer is able to
      rebound a shot off a solid surface like a wall one or more times to strike a
      target outside her line of sight. There must be a clear path to the target
      traversing fewer squares than the outside limit of her bow's range, and the
      shot is made at a -4 penalty, not including any range modifier. The archer
      must have some ability to perceive her target without a clear line of sight,
      such as the blindsight ability above.

      <2>\n__Shadowdancers are stealthy characters whose affinity for shadows goes
      beyond merely finding them useful concealment -- instead, these characters
      form a mystical bond with shadow, learning to use shadows for protection,
      travel and even allies. Shadowdancers are a diverse society, travelling
      across Theyra in tropes and staging elaborate, sinister dances for adoring
      audiences -- their order harbours many secrets but is not, ultimately, a
      malignant force in the world.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The shadowdancer is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become a
      shadowdancer, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Move Silently +8, Hide +12, Perform +10,
      Athletics +7.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Mobility.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the shadowdancer are 
      Balance, Bluff, Decphier Script, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Listen, 
      Move Silently, Perform, Search, Spot, Pick Pockets, and Tumble. 
       
      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The shadowdancer is proficient with all
      simple weapons, daggers, blades, thrown weapons, flexible weapons,
      archery and light armour.\n
      __*_<7>Evasion<2> -- A shadowdancer that makes a Reflex
      save to avoid an area-effect attack takes no damage. Levels of this
      ability from shadowdancer and other classes stack toward gaining
      Improved Evasion.\n
      __*_<7>Uncanny Dodge<2> -- A shadowdancer has a preternatural ability 
      to avoid harm. Levels of this ability gained from shadowdancer and
      other classes stack.\n
      __*_<7>Hide in Plain Sight<2> -- A shadowdancer is able to use this
      ability to slip away into shadows, hiding even when directly observed
      by other characters, at 3rd level.\n
      __*_<7>Infravision<2> -- A shadowdancer gains the ability to see in 
      the dark for 20 feet (2 squares) or has her darkvision range extended 
      by 20 feet (2 squares) culmulatively at 2nd, 5th and 9th levels.\n
      __*_<7>Shadow Illusion<2> -- A shadowdancer gains the innate ability to 
      use <9>animate shadows<2> at 2nd level, <9>mirror image<2> at 7th level
      and <9>shadow monsters<2> at 10th level.\n
      __*_<7>Shadow Companion<2> -- Starting at 4th level, a shadowdancer
      gains the ability to summon shadows from the Demiplane of Shadows.
      Unlike most shadows, these creatures are not ravenous predators of
      life, but instead loyal and dependable allies. The shadows gain the
      elder template when the shadowdancer reaches level 6 and the ancient
      template when the shadowdancer reaches level 9.\n
      __*_<7>Shadow Step<2> -- A shadowdancer gains the innate ability 
      to cast <9>shadow step<2> at will, starting at 4th level. This
      ability allows her to teleport herself short distances so long
      as she is in a shadowy area; the distance travelled depends upon
      her level as a shadowdancer.\n
      __*_<7>Defensive Roll<2> -- If you have this ability, you are able to 
      move with the impact from blows, lessening their effect even if they do 
      hit you. This ability does not function in heavy armour. When you are 
      struck by a creature that needs a 15 or greater to hit you, you only 
      suffer a certain fraction of the damage, starting at 5/6th. The number 
      of sixths of the total damage can be further reduced in the following 
      circumstances, to a minimum of 1/6th:\n
      __* You are Small and your foe is Medium-sized or larger (-1/6th).\n
      __* Your foe can only hit you on a natural 20 (-1/6th).\n
      __* You are unarmoured (-2/6ths) or in light armour (-1/6th).\n
      __This ability does not function if you have spells active which
      simulate the effect of heavy armour (such as Spirit Armour) and
      Mage Armour is treated as medium armour for this purpose.\n
      __*_<7>Improved Uncanny Dodge<2> -- A shadowdancer
      can no longer be flanked except by a rogue four levels higher.

      <2>__Some monks, rather than continuing to develop along the more conventional
      route, choose to take up the path of the tattoo mystic -- an ancient tradition
      involving the creation of magical tattoos to augment a martial artist's strength
      and prowess. These supernatural artisans are anything but pragmatic, however,
      viewing their craft as both a great form of art and an ability to express the
      inner, totemic natures of their beings. Steepled in myth and metaphor, the way
      of the tattoo mystic involves fasting, dream interpretation, the careful study
      of animals and an advanced understanding of alchemy, used in the preparation of
      the supernatural inks used for tattooing.

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The tattoo mystic is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured
      class for all characters. In order to become a tattoo mystic, 
      a character must have must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- The understanding of the complex metaphors,
      animal allegories and legends the tradition is steepled in requires
      Knowledge (Mythology) +8 and Knowledge (Nature) +8. To prepre the
      tattoo inks, a character must also have Alchemy +8.\n
      __*_<7>Base Attack Bonus<2> -- A character must have a brawling BAB of
      +3 before they can enter the tattoo mystic class.\n
      __*_<7>Abilities<2> -- A potential tattoo mystic must possess the
      Unarmed Strike class feature.

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the tattoo mystic are Appraise, Athletics, Balance, Climb, 
      Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Find Weakness, Healing, Hide, Jump, Knowledge, 
      Listen, Move Silently, Poison Use, Spot and Tumble.

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Tattoo mystics receive no additional weapon
      or armour proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Monk Abilities<2> -- A tattoo mystic continues to advance his 
      existing Unarmed Attack, Increased Move and Stun Attack abilities just as
      if he were taking monk levels, so a monk 5/tattoo mystic 3 has the base
      base damage, stun attack save DC and so forth that a monk 8 would.\n
      __The tattoo mystic does not gain any further benefits of monk levels,
      such as better Flurry of Blows, abilities like Abundant Step, Leap of
      the Clouds or Diamond Body, bonus feats and so forth.\n
      __*_<7>Tattoos<2> -- The primary benefit of becoming a tattoo mystic, of
      course, is the inscription of magical tattoos on the character's body. A
      tattoo mystic gains a new tattoo every even level, and many of the effects
      of these tattoos scale with her tattoo mystic level. Some of the tattoos
      available to the mystic include the Tiger, Sun, Mantis, Demon, Crane,
      Dragon, Scorpion, Dragonfly, Mountain, Bamboo, Monkey, Butterfly, Spider,
      Eye and Tree.

      <2>\n\tMaeve honours the most skilled huntsmen of the faerie and mortal
      relms by making them members of her Twilight Hunt, also called the Wild
      Hunt. Twilight huntsmen promote her chaotic plans.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The Twilight huntsman is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured class
      for all characters. In order to become a twilight huntsman, you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Move Silently 5, Animal Empathy 5, 
        Hide 5, Atheltics 8, Ride 8.\n
      __*_<7>Religion<2> -- You must worship Maeve.\n

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the twilight huntsman are Animal Empathy, 
      Appraise, Climb, Concentration, Healing, Hide, Jump,
      Knowledge, Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Search, Spot,
      Swim, and Wilderness Lore. 

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- The twilight huntsman gains no weapon or armour
      proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Low-Light Vision<2> -- At 1st level, the twilight huntsman gains
      40 feet (4 squares) of low-light vision.\n
      __*_<7>Fast Mount<2> -- A twilight huntsman can 
      spur her mount to speeds beyond the norm for its kind. Each twilight 
      huntsman level adds a 5~ class bonus to her mounted speed.\n
      __*_<7>Fast Move<2> -- The twilight huntsman can move  quite rapidly on her 
      own, gaining a 5~ class bonus to her movement rate for every twilight
      huntsman level.\n
      __*_<7>Tracking<2> -- Starting at 2nd level, Twilight huntsmen gain the
      ability to track their enemies just as rangers do; levels of ranger
      and twilight huntsman stack for this purpose.\n
      __*_<7>Spells<2> -- Like assassins, twilight huntsmen dabble in magic,
      learning some of Maeve's tricks of enchantment, illusion and chaos-
      magic to aid them in their mission. A twilight huntsman gains one caster
      level for every even class level, and they draw spells from their own
      spell list. Twilight huntsmen cast as priests do, being able to cast in
      armour and not depending on spellbooks, but needing a holy symbol and
      the favour of their diety.\n
      __*_<7>Smite Law<2> -- At 3rd level, the twilight huntsman gains
      the ability to smite lawful creatures, exactly as a paladin smites
      evil creatures; she gains +2 damage on such smite attacks at 3rd
      level, and an additional +2 for every twilight huntsman level thereafter.\n
      __*_<7>Relentless<2> -- Once a twilight huntsman has begun the hunt for
      an enemy of Maeve, there is no force short of utter annihiliation that
      will turn her away from her task. This intense focus is represented in
      game terms by the Dwarven Focus ability, gained at 4th level.\n
      __*_<7>Noble Aegis<2> -- At 4th level, the twilight huntsman's role
      as an appointed soveriegn of Maeve is recognized in the form of a
      noble aegis that protects her from base treachery in the form of a
      +4 bonus to defense versus surprise attacks and a reduction of two
      points per level after 4th of a rogue's Sneak Attack damage against
      her. Levels of this ability from being a twilight huntsman and a
      priest with the Nobility Domain stack.\n
      __*_<7>Scent<2> -- At 5th level, the twilight huntsman can detect creatures
      by Scent within 30 feet (3 squares) (or has her current scent range 
      extended by 30 feet).\n
      __*_<7>Freedom of Movement<2> -- At 6th level, the twilight huntsman
      becomes completely immune to paralysis, petrification, slowing,
      entangling, and other effects that constraint movement.\n
      __*_<7>Twilight Walking<2> -- At 7th level, the twilight huntsman gains
      the ability to move in and out of the ethereal plane at will, exactly
      as a phase spider does.\n
      __*_<7>Spook<2> -- At 8th level, the twilight huntsman learns to heighten
      her already unsettling faerie otherworldliness to a pinprick sharpness,
      causing intense disquiet in others around her; in game terms, she can
      evoke <9>spook<2> as a spell-like ability at will.\n
      __*_<7>Feed Upon Pain<2> -- At 9th level, the twilight huntsman learns
      to draw strength from those she stalks and wounds, healing one HP of
      damage for every 10 points she inflicts in combat.\n
      __*_<7>One Body, One Soul<2> -- At 10th level, the twilight huntsman
      gains the One Body, One Soul feat, even if she doesn't meet the normal
      requirements for that feat.

      \n\n<10>SPELL LIST<2>\n
      <15>__1st level -- <1>bane, change self, charm person, colour spray, doom, 
      enthrall, faerie fire, inflict light wounds, longstrider, malignance, 
      phantasmal force, slow poison, true strike.\n

      hallucinatory terrain, improved spectral force, inflict critical wounds,

      <2>__The Underdark is a ruthlessly Darwinian enviornment where only the strong survive.
      Even among the drow, illithids and deep gnomes, there are few who venture outside their
      large cities in order to explore the tunnels -- magical, predatory beasts unheard of on
      the surface lurk in the twisting tunnels, and most intelligent humanoids travel outside
      their communities only in the company of large military units. Valued by their people as
      spies, scouts and escorts in matters of skullduggery where large military support is too
      conspicious, there is a unique prestige associated with those rugged men and women who
      are able to survive alone in the harshest enviornment on Theyra.\n
      __Underdark warriors hone their instincts, learning to fight based upon lightning
      intuitive reaction rather than rational thought. They sharpen their senses beyond what
      other members of their races would believe possible without magic, learning to detect 
      foes by the vibrations their movement produces in the stone in utter, lightness 
      darkness.

      \n\n<10>CLASS REQUIREMENTS<2>\n
      __The Underdark Warrior is a prestige class. It counts as a favoured
      class for all characters. In order to become an underdark warrior, 
      you must have:\n
      __*_<7>Race<2> -- You must be of a race native to the Underdark -- drow,
      deep gnomes, cave orcs and kobolds all qualify among the player races,
      but goblins and illithids are known to become underdark warrior on occasion
      as well.\n
      __*_<7>Skills Levels<2> -- Move Silently +10, Hide in Shadows +10, Climb +10.\n
      __*_<7>Feats<2> -- Blind-Fighting, Toughness.\n
      __*_<7>Attributes<2> -- Good instincts are an absolute prerequisite of this
      class -- an underdark warrior must have a Wisdom score of 17
      before external magical augmentations are taken into account.

      \n\n<10>CLASS SKILLS<2>\n
      __The class skills of the underdark warrior are Athletics, Balance, Bluff,
      Climb, Escape Artist, Find Weakness, Hide in Shadows, Jump, Listen, Move 
      Silently, Spot, Swim, Tumble and Wilderness Lore.

      \n\n<10>CLASS FEATURES<2>\n
      __*_<7>Proficiencies<2> -- Underdark warriors do not gain and additional
      weapon or armour proficiencies.\n
      __*_<7>Tremorsense<2> -- The underdark warrior learns to feel vibrations
      in stone in exactly the same manner that some monsters do, developing the
      Tremorsense ability with a range in squares equal to twice her class 
      level.\n 
      __*_<7>Supremely Skilled<2> -- The survivalist nature of the underdark trains
      certain physical skills as no less lethal enviornment possibly could. The
      underdark warrior adds her class level to her Climb, Hide and Move Silently
      skill ratings.\n
      __*_<7>Fasting<2> -- Like rangers, underdark warriors sometimes need to
      survive with very little food and thus condition their bodies to cope well
      with times of privation. Levels of this ability from ranger and underdark
      warrior stack.\n
      __*_<7>Bonus Feats<2> -- An underdark warrior gains Close Quarters Fighter
      as a bonus feat at level 2, Improved Initiative as a bonus feat at level 3
      and Zen Defense as a bonus feat at level 5.\n
      __*_<7>Uncanny Dodge<2> -- The underdark warrior gains the Uncanny Dodge 
      ability at 2nd level; levels of this ability gained from the barbarian or
      rogue classes stack with those gained from underdark warrior.\n
      __*_<7>Stonework Sense<2> -- Starting at 4th level, underdark warriors
      develop a sense for stonework identical to the ability possessed by dwarves
      and gnomes. If they already have this ability, its depth increases by one
      square.\n
      __*_<7>Defensive Roll<2> -- At 5th level, the underdark warrior receives
      the Defensive Roll ability, which functions identically to the rogue special
      ability of the same name.
