   TYPE DEFINITIONS
     Most of the MA_TYPEs are self-explanatory. This information may help
   to clear up those that aren't.
                 
   MA_PERSON
       A person is a living, non-faerie humanoid creature of Medium size or 
     smaller that is not an aberration, fungus, plant or other such oddity.
     (The context of this type is the "Person" element of Charm Person, Hold
     Person, and so forth).
   MA_BEAST
       A beast is a fictional supernatural creature with some degree of 
     believable biology and ecology. A beast is neither sapient nor mindless, 
     is not humanoid, is usually native to the Prime Material, and is
     typically animalistic in character and behaviour. Examples include
     the displacer beast, blood ape and swamplight lynx.
   MA_ANIMAL     
       An animal is a real-world creature that is neither intelligent nor
     effectively mindless. Fungi, insects, plants and dinosaurs are
     specifically excluded from this catagory; birds, reptiles, fish
     and such are included.
   MA_ELEMENTAL
       An elemental is the spirit of an element that manifests as an animated
     mass of that element. Only monsters that actually have the word "elemental"
     in their name are normally of this type.
   MA_ELEMENTALKIN
       An elementalkin is a monster native to an elemental plane and tied to
     a specific element that is not a true elemental. It may be an altered
     form of an elemental, or a subrace, or such. These creatures sometimes
     appear in lieu of normal elementals when a Conjure Elemental spell is
     cast.     
   MA_EARTH / MA_FIRE / etc.
       These creatures are those that possess the corresponding monster flag
     (M_EARTH, etc.) and are tied to an element without being a truly elemental
     being. All dragons and genies, and some fae, have these ties. These beings
     can be commanded by a priest with the proper elemental Domain.
   MA_ABERRATION
       An aberration is an unnatural living creature that is not an ooze, plant
     or fungus and has definable biological processes and organs, but does not
     have a "normal" biology. Thematically, many of these creatures in this
     grouping are magical accidents or perversions of life that could not even
     exist without supernatural origin. Others have a Lovecraftian cast to them,
     such as mind flayers. Intelligent insectile creatures are often placed in
     this grouping.
   MA_VERMIN
       Vermin are creatures which are insectile in nature, or which are themat-
     ically inspired by real-world creatures that are both very small and often
     associated with insects -- spiders, snakes and worms. Vermin are usually
     mindless. 
   MA_NVERMIN ("normal" vermin)
       A subgroup of vermin including specifically only those creatures found in
     the "Vermin" appendix of the first 3.0 Monster Manual. In other words, giant
     versions of scorpions, spiders, ants, beetles and so forth. Thus, NVermin 
     are never magical or extraplanar.
   MA_CONSTRUCTS
       Constructs are mindless statues or other inanimate objects given motion
     by magic. They are not "alive", have no biology, cannot reproduce, and do
     not breathe. They are mindless, fearless and immune to many spells.
   MA_GOLEM
       A specific subgroup of constructs that are animated humanoid statues 
     composed of different materials. Golems are typically completely immune
     to all spells but a few that have different effects on them, and also
     have names of the format "[material] golem".
   MA_GENIE
       An elementially affiliated monster drawn from Arabic mythology, genies
     are intelligent, human-appearing spiritual creatures from the elemental
     planes that possess a wide variety of magical abilities related to their
     element, including wish-granting. Genies include janni, djinn, efreet,
     dao and marid.
   MA_OOZE
       Any corporeal, amorphious creature with no fixed physiology, typically 
     resembling a single-celled organism. Oozes are divided between MA_JELLY
     and MA_PUDDING in a completely arbitrary manner, usually based on name,
     to avoid "crowding" one letter.
   MA_AQUATIC
       Any living creature which has specific biological adaptations allowing
     it to breathe water, or any non-living creature which is typically found
     in water. The game creatures MA_AQUATIC creatures in rivers and other
     bodies of water in the dungeon, and ones that lack the M_AMPHIB flag can
     not be summoned with normal spells.
   MA_HUMANKIN
       Any member of the traditional human or demihuman races of D&D -- humans,
     elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings, as well as very human-like creatures
     like tieflings, aasimar, half-orcs, etc. Orcs, goblins, kobolds, etc. are
     specifically excluded.
   MA_GOBLINOID
       Goblins and related races, including orcs, kobolds, bugbears, hobgoblins
     and so forth. Trolls are not goblinoids.
   MA_GOBLIN
       Races specifically descended from goblins, including bugbears and hob-
     goblins.
   MA_TOWNIE
       Creatures typically found in towns, and only in towns.
   MA_ZOMBIE
       Skeletons, zombies and any other type of mindless undead raised by a
     necromancer's magic. Also, related higher types of such that may not
     be mindless.
   MA_REVENANT
       Catch-all grouping for any corporeal undead that are not zombies,
     skeletons, liches or nightshades -- including ghouls, huecava, etc.
     Revenants are all normally humanoid, and were once living humanoids
     who later rose from the grave.
   MA_WRAITH
       Wraiths, shadows and other undead who are essentially living person-
     ifications of negative energy.
   MA_SPIRIT
       Catch-all grouping for incorporeal undead which are not tied as
     primally to negative energy as MA_WRAITH undead are -- ghosts, spectres,
     poltergiests, etc. WW: Currently these are grouped with wraiths
     because there aren't enough of either to make it worthwhile (for
     ranger enemies, say) to split them up. 
   MA_SWARM
       A dense mass of fine, diminutive or tiny creatures. Between 300 and
     5000 creatures are represented by a swarm. A swarm is completely
     shapeable, although it usually remains contiguous. We currently 
     represent most of a swarm's abilities with A_PROX attacks. 
   MA_HOMINID / MA_SPIDER / MA_SNAKE / MA_BAT / MA_CAT / MA_WORM / MA_EYE /
         MA_QUADRUPED / MA_DOG / MA_
       Creatures which bear a thematic resemblance to the type listed above.
     Monsters in these groups are usually in a group that better defines their
     actual nature as well (undead, beast, humanoid, aberration, etc.); these 
     groups exist to spread creatures out among the letters, and to facilitate 
     items like a ring which makes all "snake-like" creatures.
   MA_REPTILIAN
       All creatures with reptilian features -- all MA_REPTILEs, along with all
     dragons, kobolds and nagas.
   MA_LYCANTHROPE
       Classical were-creatures, such as werewolves and wererats.

/*   The large-scale plan for the balance of dragons in Incursion is that
   all dragon types are of equal CR at a given age catagory, unlike in SRD
   where dragon CRs vary based on dragon type intensely. However, every
   dragon has different aptitudes, strengths and weaknesses. Consider each
   dragon type to have 25 "points" to rate 8 "catagories" from 1 to 5: the
   catagories being Melee, Magic, Breath, Endurance, Speed, Intellect, Fear
   and Flight.

      to greens; it an unavoidable impulse. Dwelling in the woodlands,

      and airbourne militia. They chafe under this domination, but are 
      realistic enough to know they presently lack the strength to take on 
      their druidic oppressors. In turn, they gather and dominate tribes of
      centaurs, hill giants, satyrs and other sylvan creatures beneath their
      iron-fisted rule; very few green dragons lack a sizable group of allies

      wide paws that allow it to readily move across
      loose snow. The tail of a blazing terror is short and
      covered in a fuzz of crystalline spikes. Otherwise
      this creature is free of markings, and blends
      effortlessly into a snow or glacial background.
        The blazing terror prefers a rugged icy environment
      where it can stealthily approach its prey. It can
      easily withstand extremely cold temperatures and is
      unaffected by wind chill. It can communicate
      simple messages with its own kind in a harsh bark,
      and hungry groups of blazing terrors occasionally
      hunt cooperatively to attack small herds. However,
      they generally prefer solitary nocturnal hunting
      when plentiful small game becomes available.
        In contrast with most of the denizens of the cold
      elemental planes, the blazing terror moves with
      startling speed. It is a ferocious hunter that will
      relentlessly pursue its prey. However, the blazing
      terror prefers to leap on its prey from ambush,
      relying on speed and surprise.
        Unlike the great cats, the blazing terror does not
      use its padded feet in combat. Instead it relies on a
      razor-sharp beak that is capable of cutting through
      armour or bone.
        A blazing terror cannot consume flesh that is not
      frozen and so will not generally hunt warm-blooded
      creatures for food. However, for reasons not fully
      understood, a blazing terror hates any being from
      an ice-free environment. Thus it will attack any
      warm-blooded creatures that are not native to the
      region, even though it has no desire to consume
      their flesh.";

shoulders, with a mass of well over 450 lbs. 
However, the front quarters are heavier, the
hindquarters lighter, and the tail is bobbed.
The favourite prey of this cat were large, thickskinned
animals like the mammoths that carry a lot
of meat. In particular they preferred to prey on
young mammoths. Once these huge creatures died
out, the smilodon became extinct.
The long, flat canine teeth of the smilodon are a
monstrous 8 in. in length, with fine serrations along
the cutting edge to increase their slashing effect.
The lower jaw of this cat can open wide during an
attack, allowing the beast to bite deep into a hide.
By biting the prey and pulling backward, the two
fangs leave long gashes to let out blood.
The smilodon has short, muscular legs and a
powerful body, making it slow but capable of

    with other resting sites, favoured hunting grounds and food storage
