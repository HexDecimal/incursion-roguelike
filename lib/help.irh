  { "<6>__Welcome to <7>Incursion: Halls of the Goblin King<6>,
     a promo game for the upcoming roguelike epic <7>Incursion: Return of
     the Forsaken<6>. This version of Incursion is still in alpha testing,
     and has limited character advancement and some unimplemented skills and
     features, but remains a fully playable roguelike game.
     \n__<14>You can type '?' at any time to bring up Incursion's online

     <14>THE GOAL OF THE GAME\n
     ====================<6>\n
     __The Forsaken -- primordial mage-lords who made pacts with things
     beyond the edge of creation -- were sealed into a ceaseless, ageless
     slumber eons ago during the sorcery wars. Now, their sleep grows
     restless and troubled, and the thirteen signs and omens the holy
     texts claim will presage their awakening have befallen:
     trees grow warped and crooked, seven nations fall to the hand
     of one, and a crimson fire rains from the sky for three days and
     three nights over the town of Akrenstone. The fourth sign is a great
     goblin horde boiling forth from the bowels of the Earth to overwhelm
     a good king. In efforts to preempt this overturn, many would-be adventurers are making
     the long and harsh journey to war-torn Mohandi, which holds the one
     known entrance to the labyrinthine underground citadel known as the
     Goblin Caves.\n 
     __In order to win Incursion, you must create a character and advance
     him (or her) from 1st to 11th level, accumulating enough class abilities 
     and magical items to be able to delve down to the tenth and final level
     of the Goblin Caves, wherein can be found the fortress of Murgash, the
     Goblin King. Slay Murgash, and the hordes of goblinoids will disperse
     on their own. Fail, and they will spread across the surface of Therya like
     a plague upon the land. Even should you succeed, you must escape with
     your life and return to the surface world. Do these things and you will
     receive the fame and glory of a hero of legend, but beware! Rumours claim
     Murgash is dealing with things far fouler than just goblinoids in the
     shadowed caverns deep beneath the stone...\n\n

     <14>NOTES ON GAMEPLAY\n
     =================<6>\n
     __Incursion plays differently than existing roguelikes,
     and it's recommended that players have some experience with at least
     one other roguelike game before trying Incursion. Beyond this, some
     basic recommendations include playing a physically tough character to
     get a handle on the game before adventuring into the more nuanced
     classes. Orcs, lizardmen, dwarves, druids, rangers and paladins
     all make ideal choices for a new player. Halflings begin with a lot
     of food, which can be useful to a newbie who finds they keep running
     out due to resting frequently.\n
     __It is wise to map out a single level fully before diving lower, and
     ideally a character's level should equal or exceed the dungeon level
     he's currently in. Note that in Incursion, 'scumming' serves very 
     little purpose; good items are only generated at the same time as new 
     dungeon levels.\n\n
          
     <7>Ten Points for Experienced Roguelike Players<6>\n
     __Players who have experience with other roguelike games would do well
     to take the following points of divergence into account:\n
     __<14>1. <6> Characters in Incursion do not heal simply by the passage
     of game turns -- instead, they must use the Rest command ('z') to rest
     and recover, which means finding a way to be safe from encounters while 
     you sleep. The design intent behind this is to make hit point loss a
     serious detriment to a player, rather than simply a nuisance. The time
     cycle in Incursion is different from that found in games like NetHack
     and Crawl, where every turn bleeds off valuable food. Players can take
     the time to explore and experiment, because individual turns are not
     that valuable, but whenever you rest, more monsters are generated in
     the dungeon (until it reaches equilibrium), so there is a definite 
     pressure to accomplish as much as possible in a day.\n
     __Finding safe ways to rest is a prominent goal of any character in
     Incursion. Initially, a character can rest safely by returning to the
     surface world, and in the mid-levels of the dungeon there are special
     areas where one can rest safely -- but eventually a character will need
     to rest in unsafe locales, and should strive to find a means to survive
     doing so.\n
      __<14>2. <6> List your special abilities. Most characters in Incursion 
      have a lot of them, and they can be complex. Forgetting you have them
     will get you killed. They're all useful if used right. The design of 
     Incursion is that character abilities matter more than magic items, 
     though the latter still matter. Every ability has advantages and costs;
     determine how frequently you can use it and which problems it is best
     suited to.\n
      __<14>3. <6> Fountains are a valuable resource; use them wisely. A
      fountain can cure poison or disease and remove curses, as well as many
      other effects. Dipping magical items in a fountain can improve their
      magical properties. However, fountains can have a wide variety of negative
      effects as well. The behaviour of fountains is influenced by the Luck
      attribute; every +1 of your Luck bonus removes one possible negative
      effect from fountain use, starting with the most severe. Characters
      with a Luck bonus of +2 or higher can use a fountain without risking
      truly dire and irresistible consequences, though it can still provoke
      several dangerous effects. Characters with lower Luck will risk effects that
      can lead to ruination in the long term, especially in the
      late game.\n
      __<14>4. <6> Set up shortcuts. You can designate a default melee weapon, 
      ranged weapon and ammo, and switch between them with '-'. Once you
      have done this, you can fire in a cardinal direction with SHIFT+Arrow. 
      This makes ranged combat much less tedious. Likewise, Incursion spellcasters
      typically operate with a wide variety of defensive spells active at any
      given time; use the AutoBuff feature to keep defensive spells constantly
      active. Likewise, assign Quick Keys to spells, Yuse verbs, Tactical Options 
      and other functions you repeat frequently. All these features are discussed
      extensively in the Interface section.\n
      __<14>5. <6> Incursion opposes scumming by design. This isn't meant as any
      kind of contempt against people who enjoy patience gaming, but it's worth
      being aware of -- we had to cater to /some/ tastes over others, after all.
      When you rest, more monsters are generated, but no new treasure is generated
      beyond occasional items given to monsters to make them more of a threat. If
      you clean out dungeon levels 1-3, and have sufficient experience to move on,
      it's in your benefit to do so -- you aren't going to keep getting more items
      treading water.\n
      __<14>6. <6> The early game stage of Incursion can be very difficult -- you will
      probably die frequently -- and character generation is quite detailed. The
      design intent behind the character generation system is that every character,
      even of the same race and class, will be different in some non-trivial way
      from others. The counterpoint of this is that it's very unfair to get a really
      nice character (or just a truly /unique/ one), and then die to random chance
      right away. Likewise, much can be learned from repetition under controlled
      circumstances.\n
      __To accommodate this while preserving the intent for character uniqueness,
      Incursion implements the ability to 'reincarnate' your character after you
      die, starting again at level 1 with exactly the same stats, perks and
      random equipment you had at the beginning of the last game. A character
      can only be reincarnated if they died before reaching character level 5 and
      before descending to dungeon level 5.\n
      __<14>7. <6> Armour and shields both work differently than they
      do in any of Incursion's parent systems. Armour gives a character truly 
      significant protection, but has significant costs associated with it.
      Shields are /very/ strong, but occupy a character's active hand, which
      prevents two-weapon fighting or wielding a weapon two-handed for increased
      damage. When you create a Warrior, consider very carefully what /kind/ of
      warrior you want to create. Incursion automatically starts very Dexterity-
      dependant characters with light armour, and very Strength-dependent ones with
      heavier armour.\n
      __Read the combat chapter in the manual carefully to understand all the
      implications of the armour system.\n
      __<14>8. <6> Gods are useful. Very useful. Cultivating a relationship with
      one in the early game will strongly help you in the later game, both in
      terms of the permanent forms of blessings and bonuses you receive from your
      deity, and in terms of being able to pray for divine aid if you ever find
      yourself in a truly difficult situation. Understand the religion system,
      and remember that in Incursion, a few quality sacrifices count a great deal,
      whereas quantity accomplishes nothing.\n
      __<14>9. <6> Monsters are not always what they seem in Incursion. Humanoids
      can have classes (a dwarf rogue, for example) that aren't apparent when you
      first meet them; likewise, very similar or easily confused monsters cannot
      be told apart without special knowledge -- for example, the Knowledge (Nature)
      skill is used to tell different breeds of dangerous fungus apart, and Sense
      Motive helps you determine a character's profession and skills. A 'human'
      might very well be a 'human scarlet disciple', and the game isn't going to
      tell you that until he does something to make it obvious.\n
      __The overall most dangerous and dynamic monsters in Incursion are probably 
      your fellow humanoid adventurers -- some of them are evil mercenaries serving 
      the Goblin King, while others may provide aid to a respectable hero.\n 
      __<14>10. <6> Plan your character build ahead of time. Choosing the right
      feats, spells and combination of class levels can be key to success in
      Incursion. We often compare Incursion to a custom-car racing game, and the
      analogy is apt: success depends as much on how you build your character as
      what you do with the character once built. Before you choose to advance in
      level (which you must actively do -- it doesn't just happen when you get 
      enough experience), you should already know where any feats and skill points
      you will receive will be placed. If you don't, you're either still learning
      the game, or you haven't thought ahead enough.\n\n
     
	 <7>A Note on Balance and Stability<6>\n
	   __Truthfully, Incursion is still very much a game in development and
     has not yet found its equilibrium in regard to game balance. For all
     I know at present, it could be nearly unbeatable without cheating, or
     it could become trivially easy when certain unforeseen combinations are
     exploited. As the developer, I welcome any feedback on how the balance
     issues can be addressed to produce a better game. I can be reached at
     incursion@shaw.ca. My life is very busy at various times, however, and
	   I cannot promise to respond to all e-mail in a timely fashion.\n
	    __As it stands, if this version of Incursion proves difficult or
	    unplayably hard due to game balance limitations, the wizard mode can
	    be used to adjust the difficulty of gameplay by obtaining needed items 
	    or otherwise skewing the game in favour of the player. The primary intent
	    of this release is not to be a fully polished game, but to stand as a
	    proof of concept for Incursion's overall design, and to provide a
	    teaser for what's to come in the future. I encourage players to 
	    experiment with the game, try out the features and get in touch with
	    me to offer suggestions for any future versions.\n
	    __<6>Incursion is still in very early alpha testing. It has several known
	    game stability bugs that cause it to crash -- hopefully gracefully enough to
	    bring up a registry error dialog box, but sometimes badly enough to crash
	    completely. Fortunately, Incursion does not delete save files until it is
	    ready to overwrite them, so if Incursion does crash (at some place other
	    than in the save game routines), you can recover your game from the last
	    place you saved. What this means is that it is also in your benefit to 
	    save your game frequently, so that you don't lose a great deal when the
	    game does crash. Incursion provides an AutoSave option for this purpose.\n\n

     \n\n
     <14>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS {FQ}\n
     ==========================<6>\n
     __<14>Is Incursion based on, y'know, that popular tabletop RPG?<6> Yes,
     it is, and we think that this is one of its stronger selling points.
     The only reason this isn't mentioned more clearly is that the actual
     names are all trademarks that we can't legally use per the rules of the
     Open Gaming License.\n
     __<14>Then why didn't you follow its rules more exactly?<6> Because that
     tabletop RPG was one influence of many on Incursion, not the sole
     guiding principle. In fact, before the OGL Incursion was imagined as
     a sort of unofficial sequel to the older Roguelike game <14>Omega<6>. This
     influence can still be seen in the format of the game screen, the percentile
     speed system and in other areas. All of the sources listed on the title
     page were influences on Incursion in one way or another.\n
     __<14>Why is Incursion so buggy?<6> There's a lot of things
     which are possible for players to try and do, and the cost of
     doing business is that these interactions sometimes cause
     unexpected problems.\n
<<<<<<< HEAD
     __<14>Is Incursion open-source?<6> Yes, google the following phrase
     "bitbucket incursion rmtew" and you will find the repository.\n

     __<14>Where can I reach the author?<6> The current maintainer is
     Richard Tew, and he can be reached at richard.m.tew@gmail.com.\n
     __<14>Where can I post messages about Incursion?<6> Development related
     posts can be made to reddit.com/r/roguelike-dev/ and gameplay related
     posts can be made to reddit.com/r/roguelikes/.\n
     __<14>What's the 'resource compiler' option for?<6> It is used to compile
     the resource files (.IRC) contained in the \\lib directory after editing
     them. If you just want to play Incursion, you don't need to do anything
     with it. If you want to try editing the resource files, you can then
     recompile MAIN.IRC and see what happens. Chances are that this won't be
     very fulfilling, however, as there's currently no documentation on how
     the IncursionScript language works, and <7>no<6> technical support is
     provided for scripting at this time.
     
     \n\n
     <14>CREDITS\n
     =======<6>\n
     __All of the source code for Incursion, save what is noted below, is
     the work of Julian Mensch, and is fully copyright 1999-2006. However,
     it terms of design and gameplay, Incursion owes a great deal to the
     other roguelike games that have come before it. The primary inspiration
     was Omega, and I thus owe gratitude to both Laurence R. Brothers and
     Erik Max Francis, for creating the only roguelike that inspired me to
     genuine curiosity about its world, secrets and quests. (The influence
     of Omega may seem tertiary at the moment; it will show more clearly
     once Incursion includes cities, wilderness and quests. Of course, the
     other major roguelikes (Angband, ToME, NetHack and ADOM) all influenced
     elements of Incursion as well.\n
     __The game system that Wizards of the Coast has released under the Open
     Game License has been beneficial as well, as it forms the basis
     for the rules system that Incursion uses. I'd thus like to thank Gary
     Gygax, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Sean K Reynolds and all of the others
     for producing one of the greatest hobbies in the world. Finally, a 
     few more specific attributions:\n
     __<14>*<6>_Westley Weimer used to extensively playtest Incursion for
     me, doing some coding, helping me balance the game and generally being
     exceedingly useful. Thanks, Westley!\n
     __<14>*<6>_Incursion now has many, many playtesters, all of whom I'm
     very thankful to. However, I've had a truly prodigious amount of feedback
     from Terje S. Bo, Aaron Lambert, Adam Smith, Jussi Ylikahri, Frumple,
     Ivan Tomas, 'XenoTheMorph', 'grdice', 'purge383', 'Alik' and 'Davzz' and 
     the game would not have reached the state it has without their support!\n
     __<14>*<6>_David H. Hovemeyer placed into the public domain C++ source
     code for manipulating fractional values without floating-point math that
     proved to be most useful in the vision system.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Bjorn Bergstrom runs the roguelike development archive on
     the web, which has continually proven to be a useful resource in writing
     Incursion's monster AI, vision code and dungeon generator.\n
     __<14>*<6>_More specifically, the dungeon generator was influenced by
     articles written by R. Alan Monroe, Josh Tippets, Radomir Dopieralski, 
     and others that I tragically can no longer locate to attribute.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Martin Minow wrote the Decus CPP C++ preprocessor and placed
     it in the public domain; with just a little bit of hacking this became
     the IncursionScript preprocessor used by the resource compiler.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Friedrich Wilhelm Schroeer wrote the ACCENT compiler compiler
     tool (similar, but far superior to, YACC) that I used writing the 
     IncursionScript compiler, and he too deserves credit, if only for
     delivering me from the purgatory of shift/reduce conflicts.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Jeff Heikkinen and Bradd W. Szonye developed a system for
	   handling armour in a tabletop RPG, <7>Draft Armour System for Cytherea<6>,
	   that heavily influenced how Incursion's armour works. I want to thank
	   them for sharing this.\n
	   __<14>*<6>_Many friendly people on the rec.games.roguelike.development
     newsgroup have offered both technical advice and moral support to the
     roguelike development community; Timo Viitanen stands out in particular
     for advice for dungeon-themed roguelikes.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Many interesting Netbooks contain a wealth of Open Gaming
     Content. Incursion may contain material from: 
     <7>The Book of Beasts<6>, edited by Robert J. Hall; 
     <7>The Netbook of Creatures<6>, edited by Spencer Cooley; 
     <7>The Netbook of Feats<6>, edited by Sigfried Trent; 
     <7>The Netbook of Spells & Magic<6>, edited by Dennis Przybyla; 
     <7>The Netbook of Traps<6>, edited by Adam Nave. Credit goes to the
     original authors and contributors.\n
     __<14>*<6>_The Mersenne Twister random number generator code was written
     by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura, for which I am grateful; their
     original copyright notice is preserved after the OGL.\n
     __<14>*<6>_Finally, the greatest thanks go to my father Fred Mensch, for
     continued support over the time that I developed this game."; }

     __<5>Characters in Incursion are generated in five steps.

     \n\n
     <13>RACE {R}\n
     ====<5>\n
     __Every character in Incursion belongs to one of nine species of
     intelligent humanoids that populate Therya. These races each offer
     unique advantages and disadvantages in gameplay. A character's race
     alters four types of traits:\n
     __<13>Attribute Modifiers:<5> Each race has a set of modifiers to
     their attribute scores. For example, dwarves are more hardy than
     humans, orcs stronger and elves more charismatic. These modifiers
     stack with all other bonus types, and are permanent and always in
     effect.\n
     __<13>Racial Skills:<5> Each race has certain skills that they have
     a particular aptitude for. These skills are treated as if they were
     class skills for every class the character has. Some races also grant
     racial bonuses to certain skills.\n
     __<13>Favoured Classes:<5> Each race (except humans) have two classes
     as their favoured classes. If a multiclass character's highest class
     (or one of his equally high classes) is not a racially favoured class, then
     she receives a 20~ penalty to all experience points earned.\n
     __Humans treat all classes as favoured classes, and thus never receive
     an experience penalty for multiclassing.\n
     __<13>Special Abilities:<5> Each race offers a few unique powers or
     abilities; examples include a gnome's innate illusion magic, an elf's
     ability to meditate instead of sleeping, or an orc's ability to take
     an enemy's power by devouring his corpse. Some of these can be actively 
     used in the game by pressing 'u' and choosing the relevant ability
     from the menu, while others are always active, thus altering the
     way the game operates at different times.
     \n<7> See Also: <5> -- {RD:races} Race Descriptions
  
     \n\n
     <13>CLASS {C}\n
     =====<5>\n
     __A character enters play at level one and gains more levels throughout
     the game. These levels can be distributed among any 3 of Incursion's
     classes in any amounts the player desires. For example, a level 7
     character -- the highest that can be achieved in the current version of
     the game -- could be a Fighter 7, a Fighter 3 / Mage 4 or even a Monk 1 /
     Paladin 2 / Fighter 4. The class you choose at the beginning of the game
     is the class that your first level will be invested into, as well as the
     class that all other levels will by default be invested into if you do
     not choose the 'M'ulticlass option on the character sheet screen.\n
     __Classes grant a wide variety of different abilities as the character
     advances in level, including bonus feats, skill points and class features.
     These are described in more detail under each individual class's description.\n
     __<13>Experience:<5> You gain experience points for killing monsters and
     overcoming other challenges; the amount of experience that overcoming
     a challenge grants is determined by the toughness of the challenge in
     relation to your own power. When you have achieved enough experience
     to gain a new level, the game will notify you of this with a special
     message. Your character is not yet changed in any way. When you want to
     level up, you can do so from the character sheet screen. If you have
     more than one class, the game will ask you which of your classes you
     want to invest the level into.\n
     __Note that when two classes offer the same ability, that ability
     stacks between them. For example, both the rogue and the barbarian
     gain the Uncanny Dodge class feature, and so levels of that feature
     gained from each class add together. <13>In Incursion, the same is
     true of spellcasting chart levels.<5> For example, a mage gains one
     arcane casting chart level for every class level, while a bard gains
     one arcane casting chart level for every second class level. Thus, a
     Mage 3 / Bard 4 casts arcane spells identically to a 5th level pure
     mage.

     <13>ATTRIBUTES {A}\n
     ==========<5>\n
     __Attributes determine the basic capabilities of your character in
     Incursion. They are rolled at the beginning of the game by a method
     of your choice, and then adjustments are applied to them based on
     the race you choose. Attributes can be raised in several different
     manners during the game -- every four character levels, you gain
     a +1 inherent bonus to increase a single attribute as you wish. Your god might
     increase attributes related to his portfolio if you've been a loyal follower. 
	 Powerful magic-users can amplify their attributes with
     the <9>wish<5> spell, activities which train an attribute will
     increase it over time and many uncommon magical items and effects can amplify
     your character's attributes. However, all these methods are considered
     to be <13>inherent<5> bonuses, and any given attribute can have
     a maximum inherent bonus of +5. This makes the attributes you start
     the game with, along with your racial bonuses and the bonuses granted
     by attribute feats and divine blessings (none of which are inherent bonuses)
     important in the later stages of the game, when you will likely
     have maxed out your inherents.
     \n__There are seven attributes in total. Note that there are no real
     'prime requisites' in Incursion; while some attributes are of
     crucial importance to a given character class, every attribute
     impacts every character in a significant way. Each attribute has two
     modifiers - the first increases by one for every even point in the
     attribute, the second by one for every odd point. Each modifier is
     applied to roughly half the tasks that a given attribute impacts in
     the game.\n\n

     <7>Strength<5> {ST}
     \n__Strength is the most straightforward of the attributes, determining
     your raw physical power. It increases your ability to hit with melee
     weapons, and high strength improves the damage you inflict with all
     weapons (other than firearms, of course). Strength also determines the
     amount by which armour reduces damage from your blows -- higher Strength
     means greater penetration and more damage. Strength also determines the
     level of encumbrance you face from a given load. Encumbrance causes a wide variety 
	 of penalties and contributes to determining how quickly you get hungry. Finally,
     Strength impacts your chance of breaking down doors, your facility
     with mining and other feats of raw physical power.\n
     <13>Primary:<5>___Damage, Feats of Strength\n
     <13>Secondary:<5> +Hit, Encumbrance\n\n

     <7>Dexterity<5> {DE}
     \n__Dexterity describes your character's manual agility, precision,
     motor skill, reflexes and hand-eye coordination. It impacts your
     ability to hit with ranged weapons, and to a lesser extent with
     melee weapons. High-Dexterity combatant characters may decide to
     look at the Weapon Finesse feat, which increases Dexterity's impact
     on melee combat. Dexterity is the primary factor in determining
     a character's Defense. Dexterity also modifies a character's Reflex
     saving throw, which allows her to dodge a wide variety of attacks,
     beams and magical spells. Finally, Dexterity impacts the chance of
     being affected by most traps.\n
     <13>Primary:<5>___Attack rolls, Defense\n 
     <13>Secondary<5>: Saving Throw, Traps, Skills\n\n

     <7>Constitution<5> {CO}
     \n__Constitution rates your character's overall toughness, resilience,
     ability to withstand damage, health and susceptibility to diseases.
     It factors into your character's hit points, and also modifies
     your Fortitude saving throw, which is rolled against such
     attacks as breath weapons, petrification, polymorph and paralysis.
     Constitution also helps in casting spells that tremendously
     strain the body, or using the blood magic abilities of a witch
     or druid.\n
     <13>Primary:<5>___Hit Points\n 
     <13>Secondary:<5> Everything Else\n\n

     <7>Intelligence<5> {IN}
     \n__Intelligence governs a character's mental acuity, ability to learn,
     academic prowess and general reasoning ability. It influences
	 the number of skill points gained every level, and some
     combat Feats have intelligence prerequisites -- the highest forms of
     martial skill are as much mental as physical. Intelligence is
     valuable to spellcasters, as bonus spells are granted based on
     it, and it influences spell failure rates as well. Finally, Intelligence
     is a factor in the successful use of magical devices, and many
     non-physical skills are based on Intelligence. A character
     with a high intelligence is very flexible, having more skills and
     spells to choose from than otherwise possible.\n
     <13>Primary:<5>___Skill Points, Spell Failure\n 
     <13>Secondary:<5> Everything Else\n\n

     <7>Wisdom<5> {WI}
     \n__Wisdom is a combination of spiritual devotion, willpower, perceptual
     acuity, canniness and basic common sense. It governs a character's
     ability to search and spot, figures (along with Dexterity) into the
     avoidance of traps and the spotting of hidden beings. Wisdom is the 
     basis for most skills relating to animals, such as Animal Empathy or 
     Ride. Its integral to spellcasters as well, governing the sheer power 
     (save DC) of their spells as much as Intelligence determines finesse. 
     Wisdom is also a primary factor in the calculation of a character's Mana, 
     and finally it forms the basis of the Will saving throw, aiding characters 
     in resisting fear, confusion and mind control.\n 
     <13>Primary:<5>___Mana, Will save\n 
     <13>Secondary:<5> Everything Else\n\n

     <7>Charisma<5> {CH}
     \n__Charisma determines a character's social prowess, force of presence,
     leadership potential, comeliness and understanding of human relations.
     It influences the prices shopkeepers offer her for goods and services
     and is used for calculating the save DC for mind-affecting spells and
     magic effects. More importantly, however, it is used in the calculation
     of the maximum amount of allies of any type a character may have --
     whether they are a ranger's animal companions, a fighter's followers,
     a sorceror's summoned creatures or a necromancer's undead minions does
     not matter. Charisma also influences the chance that a party member
     will do what they are told when the protagonist gives them an order.
     Finally, it determines the chance that an ally -- whether summoned
     creature, pet or party member -- will betray the hero.\n
     <13>Primary:<5>___Allies & Reaction\n 
     <13>Secondary:<5> Shopkeepers, Everything Else\n\n

     <7>Luck<5> {LU}
     \n__The least obvious of the characteristics, Luck describes the basic
     degree of serendipity an adventurer experiences throughout her career.
     High Luck increases the chance of good magical items and treasure
     being generated in the dungeon, and decreases the chance of 'out of
     depth' monsters being created. Obviously, these are slight skewings -- 
     even the luckiest character will meet difficult monsters, and a very 
     unlucky character will still find a reasonable share of magic. Luck 
     also plays into the effects of chaotic magic, making it highly valuable 
     to sorcerors -- their wild magic surges are strongly influenced by Luck.\n

     <13>Secondary:<5> Monsters, Wild Magic
  
     \n\n
     <13>FEATS {F}\n
     =====<5>\n
     __By default, all characters receive two feats at first level, and one feat
     at every third character level (3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.) Certain races and
     classes also grant bonus feats at a given level, which are often chosen
     from a more limited list thematically tied to the class in question.\n
     __Feats play a significant role in personalizing your character, and
     in your overall tactics in the game. Buying certain feats opens the path to 
     buy others that have higher prerequisites. Remember that whenever you are 
     choosing a feat from the feat menu, you can press '?' to view the help 
     information on feat trees to help you choose intelligently.

     \n\n
     <13>PERSONALITY ARCHETYPE {P}\n
     =====================<5>\n
     __Finally, you are prompted to choose a personality archetype from a list
     of 16 options. Currently, this is purely a choice of taste.

     \n\n
     <13>STARTING EQUIPMENT {E}\n
         ==================<5>\n
     __A character's starting equipment is defined by her race, class and perks.
     Characters proficient with armour begin with armour suitable to their character
     build -- a Dexterity-based finesse warrior will receive light armour despite
     being proficient with all armour. Characters that take two-weapon fighting
     feats will receive an offhand weapon, and those with shield-related feats
     will start with a kite shield. If a character's perks grant her a powerful
     weapon, that may subsume some of the abilities of her class-based initial
     weapons -- for example, a paladin starting with the Perk: +3 scimitar of
     accuracy will start with a +3 holy scimitar of accuracy rather than a
     separate additional holy sword.\n\n
     
     <13>CALCULATED TRAITS {CT}\n
     =================<5>\n
     __Your character has a number of values that are calculated based upon the
     choices you have made, as follows:\n
     __<13>Hit Points:<5> In Incursion, all player characters and pre-named NPCs start 
     off with a base of 20 hit points, just for the virtue of being hardy, skilled, daring and lucky.
     To this is added the result of a single die roll, plus your primary Constitution
     modifier, for every level you possess. The size of the die rolled is determined
     by the class you invested the given level in -- barbarians receive a 1d12 hit
     die, for example, while bards receive only 1d6. Options on the options panel allow
     a player to set maximum hit points, always average hit points or reroll if below
     average for hit points.\n
     __<13>Mana Points:<5> Mana is determined in the same way as hit points,
     but the base value is 10, not 20, and the mana die types for every class are
     different from the hit die types. All mana gained from the dice alone is then
     multiplied by a fixed multiplier based on total character level. These multipliers
     are listed on the level table under Experience and Advancement in the Adventuring
     chapter.\n
     __<13>Fatigue Points:<5> A character's total number of fatigue points is equal
     to 3 plus her Constitution bonus, plus a bonus for each class level she has
     of +1 for every 12 accumulated 'sides' of hit dice; thus, a barbarian 3 with 
     3d12 HD would have (3 x 12 / 12 =) +3 FP, and a mage 3 with 3d4 HD would have 
     (3 x 4 / 12 =) +1 FP.\n
     __<13>Encumbrance:<5> The amount of equipment and treasure a character can carry
     is determined by her Strength; the higher a character's strength, the lower her
     encumbrance level will be when carrying a certain mass of equipment.
     There are four levels of encumbrance in Incursion. Light encumbrance makes your 
	 movement rate 90~ of normal. Moderate encumbrance makes your movement 80~ of normal, 
	 lowers your maximum fatigue by one and gives you a -1 penalty to defense class.
     Heavy encumbrance gives you 70~ normal movement, 90~ normal speed and a
     -2 encumbrance penalty to defense class, Reflex saves, and maximum
     fatigue points. Extreme encumbrance gives you 50~ movement, 75~ speed,
     a -4 encumbrance penalty to defense class and reflex saves and a -3
     encumbrance penalty to maximum fatigue.

     \n\n
     <13>THE CHARACTER SHEET {CS}\n
     ===================<5>\n
     __You can bring up your character sheet at any time during play by pressing
     'c'. This displays all of your character's primary and figured characteristics
     and breaks the total numbers down to show you how they were calculated.
     The character sheet screen also displays a list of commands on the bottom row,
     allowing you to level up ('<15>G<5>'), learn new spells ('<15>L<5>'), add a new
     class to your repertoire  ('<15>M<5>') or bring up the skill manager to advance
     your skills  ('<15>S<5>').
     __<13>Bonus Types:<5> All bonuses in Incursion have a type assigned to them,
     even if that type is 'base' -- i.e., a class gives your base bonus to attack
     rolls, saving throws and so forth. For example, the clerical spell <9>bless<5>
     gives you a +1 sacred bonus to hit, a +2 sword gives you a +2 magic bonus to
     hit and damage, and a Cloak of Resistance +3 gives you a +3 resistance bonus to
     all your saving throws. Bonuses of different types almost never stack with the only
     exception being bonuses of the types 'base', 'dodge' or 'circumstance'. Thus,
     for example, you can't cast bless four times in a row to get a +4 sacred bonus
     to hit, but the +1 dodge bonus from the Dodge feat stacks with a +4 dodge bonus
     dwarves get when fighting giants. More significantly, since base bonuses all
     stack, a Paladin 3 / Mage 2 has a base bonus to his Reflex saving throw equal
     to the base bonus of a 3rd-level Paladin plus the base bonus of a 2nd-level
     Mage.\n
     __For reference, the following bonus and penalty types exist in Incursion:
     base, attribute, magic (a.k.a. enhancement), sacred, morale, insight, artifact,
     feat, weapon, negative (i.e., negative levels), competence, size, deflection,
     damage (i.e., attribute damage penalty), rage, status, inherent, grace, dodge,
     armour, natural, skill, dual, fatigue, template, circumstance, shield, luck,
     encumbrance and resistance."; }

Text "help::interface"
  { "<5>__Incursion uses a window and menu-based user interface for most functions,
     and it should be fairly intuitive to navigate it under most circumstances.
     This section explains some of the more intricate methods in which the user
     interacts with the game.\n

     <13>SCREEN LAYOUT {SL}\n
        ==============<5>\n
     __Incursion displays in the 80x50 terminal mode, and must have a
     display screen capable of supporting this; fortunately, all modern
     Windows systems do this. The display is a normal Windows terminal
     window, and the size of the font used can be changed by selecting
     the Properties command from the system menu, which can be brought
     up by pressing [Alt + SPACE]. Pressing [Alt + ENTER] toggles the
     display between fullscreen and windowed mode. Note that the game
     is designed to be played using Raster Fonts; selecting Lucida
     Console will cause characters to be displayed incorrectly in many
     cases, since TrueType fonts often do not represent all of the
     extended ASCII characters Incursion uses in the conventional way.\n
     __In normal Incursion gameplay, the screen is divided into five distinct
     areas. The largest area is the map, which displays an overhead view of
     the area your character is exploring as represented by symbolic ASCII
     characters (your character is represented by the '@' symbol. The other 
     four areas are as follows:\n
     __<13>Traits Window:<5> The rightmost strip of the screen is called
     the Traits Window, and is separated from the map by a blue line. Here
     you see several different pieces of information about your character
     for quick reference: your name, race, classes and levels, experience
     total and attributes. The current time is also displayed here, as are
     several status conditions: your readiness (Exploring, Fighting or
     performing an extended action), hunger state, method of locomotion,
     health state and fatigue state. Attributes are shown in bright green 
     if increased by magic, brown if decreased by a spell effect or fatigue
     penalty and red if damaged by an attribute-damage attack.\n
     __Beneath your attributes are your combat values: combat mode,
     to-hit bonus, damage, attack speed, encumbrance level, defense class
     (and armour coverage, if applicable), armour ratings and movement rate.
     The meaning of all these terms is defined in-depth in the combat 
     chapter. Beneath the combat values is displayed a legend of all the
     creatures and objects currently within your line of sight, showing
     you exactly what each symbolic character on screen represents. If there
     are many things in your field of view, their names may be truncated to
     allow more to be shown.\n
     __The final two lines of the Traits Window show two horizontal
	 gauges representing your current mana and current hit points as
     proportional to their totals. When you cast spells that drain mana for
     as long as they remain active, that lost mana is shown as brown on the
     mana meter. When you cast spells costing mana that can be regenerated,
     that lost mana is shown in green. Injuries are always shown in the life
     meter in red.\n
     __Several options allow you to customize what information is displayed
     in the Traits Window, suppressing common information that rarely changes
     or replacing the list of objects in view with other kinds of quick
     reference data.\n
     __<13>Status Window:<5> The two-line status window is shown at the bottom
     of the screen. The lowest line shows your current and total hit points,
     mana and fatigue points, as well as the total value in gold pieces of all
     the coins (of any type) you possess. After this, the line lists any spell
     effects currently affecting you or any other status conditions not shown
     in the Traits Window. If you have a number of protective spells in your
     AutoBuff list, they won't all be listed separately here when active; instead,
     the status line will simply read BUFFED (to indicate all protective or
     augmentation spells have been cast), SEMIBUFF (to indicate some such spells
     are active but not others) and UNBUFFED (to indicate that none of your
     listed spells are active on you at this time).\n
     __The line immediately above the lowest line shows your current location: 
     the name of the area you inhabit, the current region in that area, the
     terrain and objects in the square your character is standing in and the
     depth you are at when in a dungeon.\n
     __<13>Message/Prompt Windows:<5> The topmost three lines of the display are
     devoted to the message window. The game will display prose text here to
     tell you what is happening as the game progresses. The message window
     clears automatically every time a new message needs to be displayed and
     the user has given input since the last message was displayed. If enough
     messages are displayed that the message window becomes full, a 
     <12>-- more --<5> prompt will be displayed, and the game will wait for the
     user to press [SPACE] before the remaining messages are displayed. This
     behaviour can be turned off using the Options Manager, causing new batches
     of messages to automatically overwrite old ones; this can be useful in the
     later game when combat involves many creatures and a great deal of text is
     shown for every turn. The 'v' command can be used to review recent messages 
     if any are missed.\n
     __Beneath the Message Window is the one-line prompt window, which is normally
     empty but is used to display various input prompts, such as the yes/no
     confirmation prompt or the spell targeting prompt.\n
     __<13>Number Windows:<5> When the game makes a dice roll for you, the results
     of that roll are displayed in one of the game's number windows. These rolls
     include attack rolls (either your attacks against other creatures or their
     attacks against you), damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks and other, 
     less common rolls such as magic resistance checks. There are two, two-line  
     number windows; one for rolls your character makes and one for rolls made
     by other creatures as a result of your spells or attacks. Both of these windows
     can be turned off in the Options Manager; their screen-space is then used to
     display more of the map.\n
     __Some rolls are not shown, either because they happen very frequently or
     because they would give away information the player should not have. In
     other cases, the numbers shown will not match the actual result of an
     action in-game -- for example, if a player is wearing an unidentified magical
     item that grants her a +4 bonus to Strength (and thus a +2 bonus to melee
     attack rolls), a perceived attack roll result of 13 will hit a monster with
     a defense class of 15 -- the increased Strength will be taken into account
     by the game even though the character is unaware of it. This information 
     might be useful to character seeking to determine the function of unknown 
     magical items.\n
     __When a roll needs to be displayed, the number window it should be displayed
     in will automatically be cleared, even if there is another roll there that
     the player has not yet had a chance to see. This is a fairly frequent 
     occurrence in Incursion; the overwritten rolls can be examined using the 'v'
     command. Additionally, sometimes all the modifiers for a roll cause its
     listing to be longer than the width of the numbers window it is displayed in;
     in this case its text will simply be truncated, but again the full roll can
     be viewed using the 'v' command.\n\n
  
     <13>USING THE HELP SYSTEM {UH}\n
         =====================<5>\n
     __The '?' command will display context-sensitive help at any time in Incursion;
     in normal gameplay it brings up a menu window listing all of the gameplay commands
     and the keystrokes bound to them, as well as allowing the user to choose one of
     several chapters of the manual to navigate to. The '/' command brings up a legend
     listing all the characters displayed on the Incursion map and what they represent
     in actual gameplay.\n 
     __Help is always displayed in a pop-up window in front of whatever else was
     on the screen when it was requested. It can be scrolled using the [PGUP] and
     [PGDN] keys; the [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys scroll more rapidly. [ESC] dismisses
     the help window and returns to the game. Incursion help includes hyperlinks, but 
     since Incursion does not use the mouse, a different means of navigating them is
     needed. A hyperlink is displayed as a two-character code enclosed in curly 
     braces; note for example the 'UH' hyperlink displayed at the top of this
     section.\n
     __A hyperlink can be selected in one of two ways. First, the [TAB] key can be
     used to jump among all the hyperlinks displayed in the current help window,
     and then [ENTER] can be pressed to jump to a currently selected hyperlink.
     More directly, you can simply type the two-character code associated with the
     hyperlink, automatically jumping to it even if it is not visible on the 
     current help page.\n
     __The hyperlinks can be used to quickly navigate long help pages. For example,
     the Wizard Spells chapter of the help has hyperlinks named according to school
     and spell level -- typing '3N' will automatically navigate to the third-level
     necromancy spells, and '2V' will send you to the 2nd-level evocation spells.
     Likewise, the feats are listed in alphabetical order, so typing the first two
     letters in any feat's name will scroll to the first feat with those two letters
     as the first letters in its name.\n\n
     
     <13>MY CHARACTER<5>\n
     The 'My Character' chapter of the manual is special in that it is customized to
     display only the help pertinent to the character you are currently playing. For
     example, if you are playing a chaotic neutral dwarven barbarian with the Power
     Attack feat, this chapter of the manual will contain the descriptions of dwarves, 
     barbarians, the chaotic neutral alignment and the Power Attack feat. Multiclass 
     spellcasters will find this chapter useful, because it lists all the spells they 
     have access to in a neat, ordered list.\n\n

     <13>MENUS AND SCROLLING {MS}\n
         ===================<5>\n
     __Incursion displays a menu in a pop-up window whenever it needs the user to
     select something from a list of choices. These menus can be navigated using
     the cursor keys, and a choice made by pressing [ENTER]; alternatively, every 
     option on a menu is assigned a letter of the alphabet in either upper or lower
     case; typing the letter in question will automatically select that item from
     the menu.\n
     __Some menus can be dismissed by pressing [ESC], cancelling the command that
     brought them up; others require a selection and cannot be closed until one
     has been made. For some menus, every option has a description associated with
     it. In this case, only the currently selected item's description will be
     displayed, and it will be shown directly beneath the listing of choices.\n
     __Frequently, Incursion displays a large amount of text in an area smaller
     than can contain that text, such as the help windows, the listing of the
     contents of a container in the inventory window or the descriptions of
     choices in a menu. This is indicated by the display of a green down-arrow
     in the area the text in displayed in. Whenever this green arrow appears,
     the text can be scrolled by pressing [PGDN] and [PGUP]. A green down arrow
     indicates that text can be scrolled further downward, while a green up
     arrow indicates that text can be scrolled further upwards.\n\n
     
     <13>QUICK KEYS {QK}\n
        ==============<5>\n
     __Quick Keys are a feature of Incursion that allows commonly used spells, verbs
     or combat options to be bound to a single keystroke. The number keys on the
     keyboard are considered Quick Keys in Incursion, and the user can bind them to
     commonly used commands, allowing those commands to be selected with a single
     keystroke. QuickKeys can be assigned to a spell in Spell Manager by moving the
     selection arrows so that the desired spell is selected, then pressing the number
     key you wish to bind to that spell. Similarly, combat options or use-verbs
     (from the 'y' command) can be bound to a Quick Key by moving the menu cursor
     to that option and pressing the number key you wish to bind.\n
     __Thereafter, the number key can be pressed at any time in normal gameplay to
     cast that spell, use that combat option or issue that verb in a single
     keystroke.\n
     __Quick Keys are associated with a specific character; they are saved when the
     character is saved, but do not apply to any other character. This is because
     different characters will rely on different techniques -- a character who
     takes the Master Disarm feat will probably use the Disarm combat option a lot,
     whereas one who doesn't, won't.\n\n

     <13>THE SELECTION PROMPT {SP}\n
     ====================<5>\n
      __The selection prompt comes up whenever you cast a spell or use a
	  special ability that can affect something other than yourself, or
	  whenever you use the Look ('l') command. It allows you to aim your
	  effects at other targets on the map, or simply to examine what is
	  around you. The selection prompt is usually accompanied by a white
	  block-cursor that highlights whatever is currently selected. The 
	  cursor keys are used to select a target as desired, while other keys 
	  can be used to examine your surroundings.\n\n 

	  <13>SELECTION TYPES\n
      ===============<5>\n
      __Four different types of input can be given using the selection
	  prompt. By pressing the associated keys, you can input a direction,
	  location, target or inventory item. Not all of these types of input
	  are accepted by every selection prompt, it depends upon what triggered
	  it. For example, the spell <9>bless<5> can be cast on either an
	  inventory item or a location, but the spell <9>hideous laughter<5>
	  can be cast only on a living creature. You can press [ENTER] at any 
      time to confirm the selection of a target, or [ESC] to cancel the selection 
      prompt completely. The selection modes are as follows:\n
	  __<13>Select a Direction ('d'):<5> Wands, breath weapons, some tactical
	  options and spells which produce a beam, bolt or ball can be fired
	  in a specific cardinal direction. When selecting a direction, pressing
	  an arrow key is considered to be making a choice, and the spell is
	  fired in that direction. Some abilities (such as <9>magic missile<5>)
	  can also be targeted at a specific creature, while others (such as a
	  polymorphed character's breath weapon) can <13>only<5> be fired in a
	  cardinal direction. You can press '*' to aim a bolt or beam at yourself.\n
	  __<13>Select a Location ('l'):<5> This selection mode allows you to select
	  a given map square as a target for a spell or ability, regardless
	  of whether there is anything in it or not. This can be useful for
	  spells like <9>dispel magic<5>, which have a circular area of effect 
	  that you are choosing the center point of. By carefully choosing the
	  focus of such effects, you can hit a maximum number of desired targets
	  while avoiding hitting targets you don't want to affect.\n
	  __<13>Select a Target ('t'):<5> You can select a monster or unattended
	  item as a target using this method. The arrow keys are used to jump to
	  the nearest item in question in the direction chosen. If you can't manage
	  to reach the target you want, you can always use the 'l' location
 	  selection mode to select a target, even if the game won't let you select
	  an empty square in response to this specific prompt.\n
	  __<13>Select from Inventory ('i'):<5> Some spells can effect either
	  external targets or items you are carrying. Pressing 'i' presents you
	  with a menu list of items in your inventory that are applicable to this
	  ability. You can cancel this list and return to selecting an external
	  target by pressing [ESC].\n\n 

	  <13>Looking<5>\n
	  __The prompt for the Look ('l') command is the standard selection
	  prompt, but the game ignores whatever you select. In other words, 'l'
	  brings up the selection prompt so that you can examine things around
	  you. In addition, four other keystroke options are explicitly listed under
	  the Look command prompt to allow you to examine things more carefully, but
	  are available from any effect prompt as well.\n
	  __<13>Examine Target ('x'):<5> This option displays a window describing the
	  target you have currently selected in greater detail, or a list of all the
	  examinable things in the square. For monsters, this shows the monster memory 
      entry in question; for weapons, it lists the weapon's combat statistics. Descriptions 
      of things will be more fleshed out in later releases of Incursion.\n
	  __<13>Examine Region ('r'):<5> This option displays the descriptive text for
	  the room, corridor or sub-area the cursor is currently positioned over.\n
	  __<13>Examine Terrain ('f'):<5> This option displays a more detailed description
	  of the terrain type the cursor is positioned over, including things like rock
	  types, webbing, piles of trash and so forth.\n
	  __<13>Map Overview ('o'):<5> This option displays the parts of the map that you
	  have seen, zoomed out to allow you to view (most of) an entire dungeon level at
	  the same time.\n
	  __<13>Examine Map ('m'):<5> This option redisplays the descriptive text you see
	  when you enter a given map for the first time, such as the overall nature of a
	  city or the origin of the dungeon you are currently in.\n\n
   
     <13>Other Selection Keys<5>\n
     __<13>Next Target ('n'):<5> On a square that contains more than one object,
     the 'n' command can be used to cycle through them sequentially. For example,
     to target a <9>magic missile<5> at a specific creature in a square with more
     than one creature in it.\n
     __<13>Target Mount ('h'):<5> When the currently displayed target is mounted,
     this option can be used to target an effect at the creature's mount rather
     than directly at the creature.\n
     __<13>All Allies ('a'):<5> This option allows the player to target all of her
     visible allies and summoned creatures, usually to give them orders as a collective
     group. It is only available when using the Talk ('t') command, and automatically
     defaults the command to giving orders.\n
     __<13>Wizard View ('w'):<5> The wizard view command brings up a pop-up window 
     listing all of the debug information for the currently selected object; it is
     available only in Wizard Mode.\n\n
   
     <13>THE INVENTORY MANAGER {IM}\n
         =====================\n
     <5>__Using the inventory manager is fairly straightforward. 
     You can move the <12>>><5> cursor by pressing the up or down arrow keys, 
     or jump immediately to the slot you want to alter by typing the letter listed 
     beside it. Pressing [SPACE] will swap the item currently in that slot with the 
     item 'in the air'.\n
     __You can type 'x' to examine the currently selected item, or 'd'
     to drop it on the ground where you are standing. Examining a weapon
     will describe its full combat statistics and the effects of any
     magical qualities it has.\n
     __<13>Containers:<5> If you have a container in one of your inventory
     slots, its contents will appear listed directly below the contents of
     the slots. If this list is longer than the available screen space, you
     can scroll it up and down by using the [PGUP] and [PGDN] keys. To take
     an item out of the container, type the item's number directly as it
     appears on the screen, counting the '0' in front of the first nine
     items listed. This will place it in your 'in the air' slot. To place
     an item into a container, put it in your 'in the air' slot and type
     's'. It will be transferred to the container listed below, if that is
     possible.\n
     __If you have more than one container in your inventory slots, you
     can flip between them by pressing [TAB]. This switches the listing
     to the next container available to you sequentially. If you opened
     the inventory screen by electing to loot a chest, that chest will be
     one of the containers you can flip to, even though it isn't in
     your inventory.\n
     __Containers have different properties. It takes more time to remove
     an item from some containers than it does from others. Specialized
     containers (like the ivory scroll case) generally offer much faster
     access to items than the backpack, which can store anything but takes
     more time to sort through.\n
     __<13>Wielding Weapons:<5> You can wield any weapon of your own size
     category or less in one hand, unless that weapon is of a type that
     specifically requires two hands regardless of size, like a long bow.
     If you use both hands, you can wield a weapon of one size category
     larger than you are.\n
     __<13>Locked Slots:<5> When your character has changed shape (as from
     a <9>polymorph self<5> spell or the druid's Wild Shape ability) you
     may not have access to some of your inventory slots; an eagle has no
     hands, for example. These slots appear in dark blue. If there is an
     item in the slot in question, it has merged into your body and, while
     you gain its benefits, you cannot manipulate it until you return to a
     form that gives you access to the slot in question.\n 
     __<13>Dividing Piles:<5> Multiple items can be grouped into a single
     entry, referred to as a pile or stack. You can perform a Drop, Stow
     or Swap inventory action on part of a pile, dividing it into two
     piles, by holding [ALT] while initiating the action. For example, if
     you have 50 gold pieces and want to drop 30, select the gold and press
     ALT-d and you will be prompted for a number to drop.\n
     __If you try to put a stack of items into a slot that can only hold
     singular items, the stack will be automatically divided, with one
     being put into that slot and the remainder staying where they are.\n\n
     
     <13>Default Weapons\n
     __<5>Incursion allows you to choose four weapons as your default weapons:
     a melee weapon, an offhand weapon (or shield), a ranged weapon (bow, 
     sling or crossbow) and a missile (arrow, bolt, rock, dagger, etc.) These
     defaults are used to determine the outcome of the Swap Weapons command,
     which allows you to toggle between ranged and melee combat easily, and
     also with the [SHIFT] + [DIR] ranged attack shortcut -- this always uses
     your default ammo, rather than having you choose a projectile from a
     menu like the 'f' command.\n
     __To select a weapon as your default weapon in one of these four categories,
     first move the inventory cursor over to the slot that currently holds the
     weapon in question, then type a capital letter representing the category
     in question: 'M' to set the chosen weapon as your default melee weapon,
     'R' for the default ranged weapon, 'O' for the offhand weapon, and 'A'
     for the default ammunition or thrown weapon.\n
     __If you type the appropriate letter over a weapon that is currently set
     as the default already, that will blank the default slot in question. This
     might be useful if you don't want the [SHIFT] + [DIR] command to work (to
     avoid dangerous typos) or if as a monk you want to set your default melee
     weapon to nothing, allowing you to use the Swap Weapons command to toggle
     between ranged and unarmed combat.\n\n

     <13>THE OPTIONS PANEL {OP}\n
     =================<5>\n
     __Incursion has a number of optimizations that can be customized to suit
     a specific player's tastes; these can all be manipulated from the Option
     Manager, brought up in gameplay with the '=' command. The player is also
     offered the choice of changing options at character creation, and they
     can be altered from the main menu on the splash screen.\n
     __The Option Manager divides options into categories, which can be scrolled
     through using the [LEFT] and [RIGHT] arrow keys; individual options can
     be selected with [UP] and [DOWN] arrows. The space bar toggles a YES/NO
     option, or scrolls through the list of choices for an option with more
     possible values.\n
     __The Option Manager also allows macros to be bound to the function keys
     in the Macro Binding page. Simply press the function key you want to bind
     a macro to, then select the macro you want to attach from the popup menu. 
     \n\n
     <list options>
     \n

     <13>MACROS AND AUTOBUFF {MA}\n
         ===================<5>\n
     __Incursion has some built-in macros to automate repetitive tasks. These
     can be bound to function keys, as described above. Currently, only the
     following macros are implemented:\n\n
     <list macros> 

     <13>LOADING AND SAVING {LS}\n
     ==================<5>\n
     __Incursion allows you to save your game at any point, but by default
     when your character dies, the game is over. If you wish to play without
     this restriction, it is easy enough to circumvent -- either by backing
     up the save files, playing in Wizard Mode or using a batch file or 
     third-party utility. That said, the game is designed to be played with
     the challenge of not dying at all.\n
     __Pressing [ESC] during gameplay brings up the system menu, which gives
     you the option of saving and continuing to play, saving and quitting or
     ending the game.\n\n
     
     <13>RECOVERING A GAME<5>\n
     __Incursion is still early in its development cycle and thus is not
     entirely stable -- it does crash on occasion. To help offset this, the
     game automatically saves every 20 turns; a crashed game can be recovered
     from this backup using the Recover a Crashed Game option on the intro
     screen. This option allows you to recover a game from the most recently-made
     backup in the event of a crash.\n\n
     
     <13>REINCARNATING A CHARACTER<5>\n
     __The Incursion character creation process is both very complex and
     designed deliberately to ensure that it produces unusual and unique
     characters as a result of Perks. However, characters can die very
     quickly and sometimes arbitrarily in the early game. To allow players
     to truly experiment with any given character, and avoid the randomness
     of character creation becoming an annoyance, the game allows characters
     to be reincarnated when they die.\n
     __When a character dies before reaching character level 5 and before
     having descended below the 5th level of the dungeon, that character is
     eligible for reincarnation. Selecting the Reincarnate a Character
     option from the main splash screen will restart the game with an exact
     copy of the selected character, including random perks, store contents,
     known alchemical formulas and random starting equipment. The character
     is first level and has no experience, however, and the dungeon itself
     will be different than it was in the prior game.\n
     __A single character can be reincarnated at most ten times."; } 

Text "help::commands"
  { "<14>COMMAND LISTING\n
         ===============<6>\n
     -- {MM:mainmenu} Return to the Main Help Menu\n
     __In comparison to most roguelike games, Incursion has a small
     list of commands. Only lowercase letters represent game commands;
     future versions will allow the player to assign the upper-case
     letters to specific items or macros for quick use. Of these,
     several are either shortcuts to a skill or different letters
     for activating a different type of magic item in essentially the
     same way. Many of the commands bring up menus and submenus which 
     will eventually allow the player to access lesser-used specific 
     functions like dissecting corpses, mixing potions or performing 
     combat maneuvers. Incursion thus has a small number of very flexible
     commands, rather than a large number of extremely specific ones.
     This was a specific design choice, intended to make the keystrokes
     easier to learn and the game simpler to play.\n
     __The command set of Incursion is as follows:\n\n  

     <15>Activate an Item ('<13>a<15>')<6> {A}
     \n__Presents you with a menu listing all of the magic items you
     possess that can be activated, provided they are in a state that
     allows activation (i.e., not out of charges, wielded if necessary,
     etc.) All items that must be actively used (rather than conveying
     a passive benefit) and are not potions, scrolls, staves or wands
     are utilized by this command.\n
     __Note that you can read an unknown scroll, drink an unknown potion
     or blast an unknown wand, but activation is presumed to involve
     command words, and thus you cannot activate an item until it has
     been formally identified.\n\n

     <15>Blast Wand or Staff ('<13>b<15>')<6> {B}
     \n__This command is used to trigger the effects of wands or staves,
     and otherwise functions identically to the Activate ('a') command.\n\n

     <15>Combat Options ('<13>c<15>')<6> {C}
     \n__The Combat Options command brings up a menu listing a variety
     of special maneuvers and combat choices available to your character,
     such as performing a Great Blow, Fighting Defensively, Sprinting or
     making a Called Shot.\n\n

     <15>Display Character Sheet ('<13>d<15>')<6> {D}
     \n__Takes you to the character sheet screen, where you can examine
     your character's traits in more detail than the main game screen
     lists. The character sheet displays breakdowns of your statistics,
     showing the different types of modifiers which stack to form each
     value, as well as listing all your feats and special abilities.
     \n__There are options at the bottom of the character sheet screen
     for developing your character. When you have enough experience to
     level up, you do so from here. The character sheet screen also
     allows you to learn spells and select similar options.\n\n
     
     <15>Eat Something ('<13>e<15>')<6> {E}
     \n__This command allows you to eat any object in your inventory that
     is edible to you in your current form, as chosen from the menu it
     presents listing such items. Note that eating takes time, and thus
     it isn't wise to do during combat.\n\n     

     <15>Fire Ranged Weapon ('<13>f<15>')<6> {F}
     \n__Uses the most easily accessible ranged weapon that you have
     to attack in a direction that you select. The weapon used is the
     one that is currently in the inventory slot closest to the top on
     the inventory screen. In the case of archery, you must wield the
     ranged weapon (bow or crossbow) in your hands before you can use 
     it to fire arrows or bolts.\n\n

     <15>Get Item ('<13>g<15>')<6> {G}
     \n__Causes your character to pick up an item on the floor, immediately
     bringing up the inventory screen and allowing you to place the item where
     you want. You must occupy the square where an item rests in order to
     be able to pick it up. If there is more than one item in your square,
     the game will display a menu allowing you to choose which one you want
     to pick up.\n\n

     <15>Hide in Shadows ('<13>h<15>')<6> {H}
     \n__This command is a shortcut to allow you to 'u'se the Hide in
     Shadows skill, as per the Use Ability command.\n\n

     <15>Inventory ('<13>i<15>')<6> {I}
     \n__This command brings up the inventory screen, allowing you to exchange
     equipment, take off items, search through your pack, and manipulate your
     inventory in any other way you desire.
     \n__<13>IMPORTANT NOTE:<5> Every inventory action you take has a time cost
     in segments. Future versions of Incursion will report to you what is happening
     around you as you perform inventory actions, but the current one does not.
     As such, if you open the inventory screen in the middle of combat and perform
     200 segments of inventory actions, as soon as you close it again your character
     will proceed to be inactive for 200 segments as the monsters attack him. Thus,
     be very cautious of inventory manipulation in combat!\n\n

     <15>Jump ('<13>j<15>')<6> {J}
     \n__This command is a shortcut to allow you to 'u'se the Jump
     skill, as per the Use Ability command.\n\n

     <15>Kick Something ('<13>k<15>')<6> {K}
     \n__This command allows you to kick a door or monster. Against an enemy,
     kicking is like punching, but it's slower and allows you to apply 1.5
     times your Strength modifier to damage. Its primary use, however, is
     for forcing open locked doors.\n\n

     <15>Look Around ('<13>l<15>')<6> {L}
     \n__Brings up an object selection prompt, allowing you to examine anything
     near you. Type '?' at this prompt for a more detailed description of
     how to use the look command's various options.\n\n

     <15>Cast Magic Spell ('<13>m<15>')<6> {M}
     \n__This command brings up the Spell Manager window, which lists all of the
     spells you know along with their success rate, mana cost and other parameters.
     This window can be used to select a spell to cast, turn Metamagic Feats on or
     off, and bind attack spells to Spellkeys for quick use.\n\n

     <15>Name an Object ('<13>n<15>')<6> {N}
     \n__This command allows you to assign any proper name of your choice to any
     item in your inventory or object (monster, item or dungeon feature) currently 
     visible on the map board. You can use it to rename your character, assign a 
     suspected effect to an unidentified item (i.e., metallic blue potion named Healing) 
     or give your pets or followers a personal identity. The latter is recommended, otherwise 
     it becomes difficult to tell the kobold ally you hit with <9>charm monster<6> from the 
     enemy kobolds that are attacking you in messages.\n\n

     <15>Open/Close Something ('<13>o<15>')<6> {O}
     \n__This command is used to open or close a door that is within one square of
     you. If there is more than one door nearby, the command will prompt you to
     choose a direction. It can also be used to open a chest in the square that
     you are currently in.\n\n

     <15>Pray to your God ('<13>p<15>')<6> {P}
     \n__This command allows you to receive aid from your god when in dire
     straits, offer a sacrifice when standing on an altar, or simply learn what
     your present standing is on your god's eyes.\n\n

     <15>Quaff Potion ('<13>q<15>')<6> {Q}
     \n__This command is used to trigger the effects of potions,
     and otherwise functions identically to the Activate ('a') command.\n\n

     <15>Read Scroll ('<13>r<15>')<6> {R}
     \n__This command is used to trigger the effects of scrolls,
     and otherwise functions identically to the Activate ('a') command.
     Note that scrolls are normally usable only by spellcasters who have
     the scroll's spell on their spell list, or by characters with ranks
     in the Decipher Script skill.\n\n

     <15>Search the Area ('<13>s<15>')<6> {S}
     \n__This command causes your character to search the area for traps
     and secret doors. This works differently in Incursion than it does
     in most other Roguelike games. You only get one chance to find a
     given trap or secret door, and if you fail you must rest before you
     can try again.\n\n 

     <15>Talk to Creature ('<13>t<15>')<6> {T}
     \n__This command allows the player to select a nearby creature to try
     to converse with, bringing up a prompt allowing the player to greet,
     distract, attempt to intimidate, trade with or surrender to the
     target creature. If the creature is friendly, this command can also
     be used to ask it if it will join your party. If the creature is an
     ally, commands can be issued.\n
     \n__When using this command, you can type 'a' at the selection prompt
     to give orders to all of your allies at the same time; this only works
     for giving orders rather than any other type of social interaction.\n\n
     
     <15>Use Ability ('<13>u<15>')<6> {U}
     \n__This command brings up a menu listing your character's actively
     usable skills, feats, racial abilities, class features and any other 
     ancillary powers your character might have, such as a divine gift
     or the special ability of a monster you have polymorphed into. If
     an ability requires an active choice to use on the player's part and
     is inherent to the character rather than coming from an item, it
     will be listed here.\n\n

     <15>View Recent Messages ('<13>v<15>')<6> {V}
     \n__This command brings up a window displaying a history of all the
     messages recently shown in the upper message window. This can be
     useful if you want to review the recent events in a battle, or if
     you accidentally struck a few keys and messages flashed by too quickly
     for you to read.\n\n

     <15>Wizard Mode Options ('<13>w<15>')<6> {W}
     \n__If you are not in wizard mode, this command brings up a prompt
     offering you the option of entering wizard mode. If you are, it
     brings up a menu allowing you to influence the behaviour of the
     game on a direct level -- viewing creatures stats, identifying
     items automatically, creating game objects and even viewing dumps
     of the assembly code the script engine runs. Wizard mode can be
     used to debug the game or new resources you have added to it, to
     experiment and learn about the functions of various monsters or
     items, or to add 'handicaps' such as superior magic items to make 
     the game easier for less skilled players.\n\n
     
     <15>Cancel Active Power ('<13>x<15>')<6> {X}
     \n__This command allows you to turn off any standing power, spell,
     item effect or ability on your character that you can stop at will.
     Most spells have a set duration and can't be shut off, but a few
     can. Use this command to get your druid to shapeshift back to his
     natural form, your bard to stop singing or your psionicist to turn
     off one of his active powers.\n\n
     
     <15>'Yuse' an Item ('<13>y<15>')<6> {Y}
     \n__This command allows you to access the nonstandard functions 
     of an item in your inventory. It can be used to apply a mundane 
     item such as using rope to climb down a chasm or filling your 
     lantern with oil, or to perform an unusual secondary action with 
     a magical item -- breaking a wand, pouring a potion over another 
     object, dipping an item in a fountain you are standing over, and 
     many other applications.\n
     \n__The command brings up a list of every item in your
     inventory, whether or not they have secondary functions, because
     it is not the intent of the game design to reveal all the possible
     secondary functions of items without experimentation. When you
     select one, the game will display a prompt allowing you to
     choose the secondary function you want for that item, assuming
     any are even available.\n\n
     
     <15>Rest and Recover ('<13>z<15>')<6> {Z}
     \n__This command allows your character to rest in a relatively safe
     place in order to recover lost mana points and fatigue points, and 
     heal a few hit points worth of injuries. Resting has many advantages, 
     requirements and dangers, and is described in full detail in the introduction.\n\n

     <15>Move or Attack ([CURSOR KEY])<6>
     \n__The arrow keys allow you to move your character in any horizontal,
     vertical or diagonal direction. Running into a monster causes you to
     make a melee attack against that monster.\n\n

     <15>Move Only ([CTRL] + [CURSOR KEY])<6>
     \n__Using [CTRL] with the cursor keys, you can cause your character to
     move without attacking, such as when you want to near a creature
     that you could hit with a reach weapon. To move <14>past<6> a hostile
     creature, you must use the Bull Rush tactical option.\n\n

     <15>Wait One Turn ('<13>.<15>')<6>
     \n__This command causes your character to wait for 30 phases, allowing
     monsters and allies to act or catch up.\n\n

     <15>Swap Weapons ('<13>-<15>')<6>
     \n__This command allows you to toggle your character between wielding
     your default ranged weapon and your default melee weapon (along with
     your default offhand weapon or shield, if any). You can set your
     default weapons using the Inventory Manager.
     \n__Note that using the swap weapons command has a lower timecost than
     performing these actions manually using the Inventory Manager. If you
     have the feat Quick Draw, it takes you 10 segments to swap weapons;
     otherwise, it takes 30 segments.\n\n

     <15>Fire Ranged Weapon ([SHIFT] + [CURSOR KEY])<6>
     \n__This shortcut for the 'f' command allows you to fire your default
     missile in a direction of your choice with a single keystroke. You
     can set your default weapons using the Inventory Manager.\n\n

     <15>Ascend / Descend ('<13>\<<15>'/'<13>\><15>')<6>
     \n__Using these commands, you can climb a set of stairs that you are
     standing directly on top of. The symbol you type is exactly the same
     as the one that appears on screen. They can also be used to climb up
     into trees, climb up or down a chasm or so forth, as described under
     the Climb skill.\n\n

     <15>System Menu ([ESC])<6>
     \n__Pressing [ESC] brings up the system menu, which offers options 
     allowing you to save or quit the game.\n\n

     <15>Online Help ('<13>?<15>')<6>
     \n__Pressing '?' displays the online help window, showing a quick
     reference to the Incursion keybindings and also offering you a menu
     of further help topics to choose from.\n\n

     <15>Display Legend ('\\')<6>
     \n__This command brings up a legend showing what all of the various different
     glyphs that can appear on screen represent in the game."; }

         <9>EXPERIENCE AND ADVANCEMENT {EA}\n
            ==========================\n<1>
         __Much like in all roguelikes, an Incursion character starts out as a
         competant but comparatively weak young adventurer and develops through
         experience over time into a very powerful, legendary hero -- provided
         she can stay alive for that long! Incursion differs from many roguelikes
         in that an Incursion character's inherent abilities are more significant
         to her overall power level than her magical equipment, which is more
         transient. A character's overall inherent competance is reffered to as 
         her <9>level<1>, which begins at 1 and increases over time.\n
         __Creating an Incursion character has already been discussed in the
         previous chapter. Once a character has been created, he is placed into 
         the Goblin Caves to fight against the many menaces therein. Whenever
         the character overcomes a challenge, he gains experience points to
         represent what he learned. Overcoming a challenge can be killing a
         monster, but in Incursion in can also include resolving a conflict
         socially, disarming a trap, picking a lock and so forth. Characters
         need a certain number of experience points in order to attain each
         level above the 1st, as per the following chart:\n
         
         <15>_Character_Experience_Base__Attribute_Mana\n

             _____11______55000______5______--______x5\n
             
         __The highest character level that can be attained in this version of
         Incursion is 11; <9>Return of the Forsaken<1> will feature character
         advancement all the way up to level 20. When you attain enough experience
         points to qualify for a higher level, you do not immediately advance to
         that level. Instead, you must go to the character sheet and press 'G' to
         invoke the Gain Level command.\n
         __<9>Think very carefully about your character before advancing a level.<1>
         Once you press the 'G' key, you must immediately make any character-design
         choices (such as feat selection, attribute gains, which class to invest the
         level in, etc.) required to gain a level. Not only are these choices
         permanent, you cannot even abort the selection prompt if you change your
         mind as you can most other prompts in Incursion.\n
         __The choices you make in designing your character will play a strong part
         in your success in the game. Think about them carefully before advancing
         -- a skillful Incursion player will already know what feats she wants and 
         which classes in which combinations before actually advancing.\n
         \n

        <9>RESTING AND FATIGUE {RF}\n
           ===================<1>\n
        __In Incursion, the simple passage of time does not restore lost hit
        points, mana points or fatigue points. Instead, the player must use
        the rest ('z') command to achieve this. However, resting has a wide
        variety of consequences, and so it's important that it be done
        tactically. Resting has the following effects:\n
        __<9>*<1>_Your character recovers all of his mana points.\n
        __<9>*<1>_Your character heals a number of hit points of damage equal to
        [(character level + 3) x Constitution] / 8.\n
        __<9>*<1>_Your character recovers all of his fatigue points unless
        he is exhausted, in which case resting once only causes him to
        recover his Constitution modifier (minimum 1) worth of fatigue points.\n
        __<9>*<1>_You may have an encounter. The chance of this is strongly
        influenced by how many monsters are nearby, how close they are, and
        how many doors are closed (and preferably locked) between you and them.
        Additionally, the deeper you are in the dungeon, the larger a radius
        it is that constitutes 'nearby'.\n
        __<9>*<1>_New monsters are added to the dungeon, on the current level
        and every level above it. This only occurs when you rest. Note that this 
        makes it unsafe to rest twice in a row without killing the new monsters 
        that may be nearby.\n
        __There is a certain amount of monsters that is considered to be a given
        dungeon level's monster equilibrium. When it is reached, no new monsters
        will be generated. This number is always higher than the number of monsters
        a level starts with, and higher the deeper into the dungeon you go. This
        makes it more dangerous to rest frequently deeper into the dungeon, as 
        the player can end up swamped in monsters.\n
        __<9>*<1>_Eight hours pass, and thus all timed magical effects wear off. 
        This means that an encounter will occur without any prepared magical defenses, 
        which can be Bad.\n\n 
        
        <9>Encounters<1>\n
        __Encounters are much more dangerous than normal fights
        for several reasons. The encounter normally starts off with multiple monsters
        in melee range with the player, and the player only just waking up. Thus,
        the monsters have time to attack before the player does. Deeper into the
        dungeon, this can be lethal.\n
        __If a character has an encounter when resting, the full normal number of
        hit points and mana points are not restored. Instead, only a fraction are
        regained, based on the number of hours that character was able to rest for
        peacefully before the encounter occurred.\n\n
        
        <9>Resting Safely<1>\n
        __An encounter can quite easily kill even a very powerful character,
        especially in consideration for the rules for the Coup de Grace maneuver.
        Fortunately, there are many ways in Incursion to rest safely, negating or
        lessening the risk posed by encounters. One of foremost goals a character
        must achieve in the game is to secure a safe method of resting so that
        they can recover from injuries and other maladies; without the ability
        to rest safely, a character is surely doomed.\n
        __Incursion includes the following methods of resting safely or at least
        reducing encounter risk:\n
        __<3>*<1> At the very beginning of the game, characters can ascend the
        stairway out of the dungeon to rest with perfect safely on the surface
        world. This allows characters a 'growth margin' to uncover supplies or
        gain a few levels they need to develop a more long-term resting plan.\n
        __<3>*<1> Certain rooms in the dungeon, referred to as Places of
        Sanctuary, allow a character to rest safely in them with no chance of
        an encounter occuring. Unfortunately, these rooms do not occur frequently
        enough to cover all the resting a character will need to do, /unless/ a
        character can user her expendable resources (hit points, mana, fatigue)
        very efficiantly and sparingly.\n
        __<3>*<1> Some spells -- <9>rope trick<1> and <9>alarm<1>, notably, allow
        safe or safer resting.\n
        __<3>*<1> Characters with allies or animal companions can take watches
        when they rest. An alert group is much less likely to be attacked than
        a single, sleeping individual; the exact mechanics of this are described
        under the Spot skill.\n
        __<3>*<1> Characters with the Diplomacy skill can [R]equest that neutral
        NPCs take watches with them just as allies would, persuading them to act
        in an agreement of mutual benefit.\n
        __<3>*<1> The Uncanny Dodge ability allows barbarians and rogues of
        sufficient level to wake instantly when threatened -- it does not prevent
        enocunters from happening, but does prevent monsters from using the
        Coup de Grace maneuver on the sleeping player, or getting rounds of
        free attacks.\n
        __<3>*<1> Elves have a racial ability called Reverie that allows them to
        meditate rather than sleeping.\n
        __<3>*<1> Halflings begin play with Hearthstones of Onanda, a limited
        supply of one-use magical items that allow guaranteed safe resting.\n\n
        
        <9>Losing Fatigue<1>\n
        __Characters spend or lose fatigue for a wide variety of reasons. 
        Performing the special maneuvers, berserking, using metamagic feats
        and getting poisoned or diseased all cost a character Fatigue Points.
        Some spells and supernatural abilities also drain fatigue.\n
        __Further, characters also lose fatigue gradually over time as a result
        of swinging a weapon in combat. An unarmoured character loses
        a fraction of a fatigue point equal to [(10 + weapon weight) /
        10000] with every swing; when the total loss adds up to a whole
        fatigue point, a message will be displayed stating that your
        character feels more fatigued from fighting.
          Armoured characters gain fatigue much more quickly based on
        the type of armour they wear; instead of the fatigue point
        fraction having a denominator of 10000, the denominator is
        specified by the armour. Armour with the featherlight quality
        has a denominator three times greater than normal, meaning
        characters in featherlight armour gain fatigue three times
        more slowly.\n\n

         <9>TERRAIN AND MOVEMENT {TM}\n
            ====================\n<1>         
        __All Incursion characters have a base percentile movement rate determined 
        by their Size: Small races have a base 75~, while Medium races have a base
        100~ movement. Dwarves are the exception, having the base movement of a 
        Small race even though they are Medium-sized. Barbarians and monks both
        gain inherent increases to their movement rate; there are also spells and
        magical items that affect movement rate, and encumbrance and fatigue can
        both lessen it. The exact manner in which your current movement rate has
        been calculated is shown on the character sheet, as with all other
        calculated values.\n
        __There are many different kinds of terrain and natural obsticles in 
        Incursion; terrain-based modifiers to movement will show up on the status
        bar, but are not listed on the character sheet. Terrain can have many other
        effects as well. Here is a sampling of the rules governing terrain in
        Incursion; just like any other object in the game, unusual terrain can be 
        examined with the 'L'ook command to determine its effects.\n\n
        
        <9>Fog<1>\n
        __Fog obscures vision but not movement (though some claim there are special
        magical fogs which impede movement as well). Characters cannot see further
        than 10 feet (one square) past a square with fog in it. Thus, they can
        perceive creatures they are in melee with, but not anything more than one
        square distant from them. Fog does not (normally) impede tremorsense,
        blindsight, telepathy or magical detection abilities.\n\n
        
        <9>Chasms and Pits<1>\n
        __Chasms are large areas of open space with no floor. Characters who move
        into a chasm square will fall to the next dungeon level; if there is a chasm
        at the same spot on that level as well, they will continue falling. Many of
        these rifts are very deep, covering several levels. Monsters are also capable
        of using the Bull Rush maneuver to force a character into a chasm.\n
        __A character suffers 3d6 points of damage per dungeon level she falls, if
        she lands on a hard surface. The Balance skill, the Slow Fall ability possessed
        by monks and the <9>feather fall<1> spell all help to reduce falling damage.\n
        __If the area of the level directly above the character corresponding to her
        location on her current level has a chasm, normal floor squares will be coloured
        light cyan to indicate this, and the Location line will include the text 
        '(open above)'. In these areas, a character with the Climb skill can attempt
        to ascend to the level above her, as described in that skill's writeup; Climb
        can also be used to descend a chasm safely without suffering falling damage.\n\n
        
        <9>Slick Surfaces<1>\n
        __Slick ground, such as ice or greased stone, requires a Balance check to
        fight on, or sometimes even to move across; failing the check causes the
        character to become prone, just as if they had been tripped. Flying or
        levitating characters are unaffected by slick sufraces.\n\n
        
        <9>Water<1>\n
        __Water has varying depths in Incursion -- shallow water is safe to wade
        through; deep water requires the Swim skill to cross safely, as described
        in greater detail in said skill's writeup.\n
        __Thrown weapons are ineffective against targets in
        the water. Fire damage is ineffective against targets in the water
        unless the attacker makes a DC 20 Spellcraft check. Aquatic creatures in the
        water attacked by creatures not in a water square gain a +8 defense
        bonus.  Blunt, slashing and ranged attacks suffer a -2 penalty to hit
        creatures in the water (unless the attacker has Free Action).
        Blunt and slashing attacks do half damage to creatures in the water
        (again, unless the attacker has Free Action).\n\n
        
        <9>Tight Spaces<1>\n
        __Some areas of the dungeon, such as the warrens wherein kobolds live, can
        be very constricting to human-sized characters. When such characters enter
        a confined space, they receive a message warning them of such, and then
        lose their Dexterity bonus to their defense class. In addition to losing
        their bonus, such characters are subject to the Sneak Attack special ability
        of rogues and some monsters. This penalty ends as soon as the character
        leaves the confined space.\n
        __Large-sized creatures such as ogres suffer similar confinement in tunnels that
        are comfortable for human-sized creatures, and cannot even enter areas that
        are sized for kobolds, halflings and their kin.\n\n
        
         <9>DUNGEON HAZARDS {DH}\n
            ===============\n<1>         
        __Beyond the obvious monsters, there are many other threats to a character's
        survival in a dungeon. Some of these are discussed in greater depth below.\n\n
        
        <9>Attribute Loss<1>\n
        __Attributes determine a character's raw, fundamental capabilities; almost
        every roll in Incursion is modified by an attribute. It's not surprising,
        then, that there are several powers and effects in the game which target
        attributes directly. Attributes can be artificially lowered in three
        different ways in Incursion:\n
        __<9>Attribute Penalties:<1> Several status conditions apply a penalty to
        one or more attributes. Being Stunned lowers Dexterity by six for as long
        as the character remains Stunned, for example, representing dizzyness and
        inability to move accurately. Likewise, being fatigued reduces a character's
        Strength, Dexterity and Charisma by two each. Attribute penalties apply for
        as long as the condition lasts and the attribute returns to its normal level
        when the condition ceases. Attribute penalties can never kill a character,
        instead reducing an attribute to a minimum of 1.\n
        __<9>Attribute Damage:<1> Some spells and special attacks of monsters damage
        an attribute. These effects have a normal damage roll, but instead of
        subtracting hit points, they remove points from an attribute. If an attribute
        is reduced to zero or lower as a result of attribute damage, the subject dies.
        Normal healing spells and potions do not heal damaged attributes, but the
        clerical spell <9>restoration<1> and certain specific potions can heal
        attribute damage. Most characters heal one point of attribute damage every
        night of undisturbed rest, as well. Halflings heal attribute damage more
        quickly, and the Heal skill can also be used to treat attribute damage.\n
        __<9>Attribute Drain:<1> Attribute drain is similar to attribute damage,
        but rarer and far more dangerous. Attribute drain lowers an attribute from
        a damage roll just like attribute damage, and if any attribute reaches zero
        from any combination of drain and damage, the character dies. However,
        attribute drain does not heal naturally. Instead, it is essentially a curse,
        and lasts until a <9>remove curse<1> spell or any equivalent magical effect
        is applied to the character. Attribute drain can also be cured by magical
        effects designed specifically designed to restore attributes, such as a
        <9>Potion of Restore Intelligence<1>.\n\n
        
        <9>Poison and Disease<1>\n
        __Poisons and diseases work similarly in Incursion: both normally inflict 
        attribute damage over a period of time until cured or overcome. If a character
        makes an initial saving throw successfully, they are not considered to be
        poisoned or infected at all. Otherwise, the character will normally suffer 
        immediate damage
        to one or more attributes, and then this damage will recur every set number
        of turns. Every time the damage occurs, a Fortitude save is allowed against
        the poison's save DC; success negates the damage. Once a certain number of
        successful saves have been made, the damage will stop occuring permanently
        and the character will be said to have overcome the poison. Some very strong
        poisons require the character to make a certain number of successful saving
        throws all in a row, with even one failed save negating any progress made.\n
        __The mechanics of poisoning a weapon and using poisoned weapons are 
        discussed in the writeup for the Poison Use skill.\n
        __Diseases work similarly to poisons, with the following exceptions: the
        number of turns between saves are usually much longer, since diseases
        progress much more slowly than poisons. Additionally, a character cannot
        rest while poisoned, but can rest while diseased. If a character chooses
        to rest while diseased, a single iteration of the disease's effects
        automatically occurs, regardless of the number of turns left before the
        next normal iteration, but the character receives a +4 rest bonus to the
        Fortitude saving throw.\n
        __Certain spells can be used to cure diseases and poisons; the Heal skill
        also allows them to be treated. You can always view the exact game effects
        of a specific disease, as well as learn how many successful saving throws
        you have made against it to date, by using the [C]onditions option on the
        character sheet screen.\n\n
        
        <9>Traps<1>\n
        __While the primary threat to an adventurer's well-being in dungeons is
        monsters, traps also present serious hazards not to be underestimated.
        Traps in Incursion are assumed to be pressure-plate based, so flying or
        levitating characters don't trigger them. They occupy an entire floor
        square and are triggered by moving on to that square, and are invisible
        until detected. Discerning the presence of a trap requires a Search
        check against a base DC of 15 (for a mundane trap) or 20 (for a magical
        trap), +1 per level of the trap. Characters can only attempt to detect
        a given trap once per day. When a character is going to move into a
        trapped square, a detection check is automatically made, mostly to 
        avoid the meniality of the player having to constantly search for traps
        manually. The 's'earch command can also be used to uncover the presence
        of any traps in the nearby area, which can be useful to search a room
        without walking over every single square.\n
        __When a character walks into a square with an untriggered trap in it, 
        she makes a saving throw (usually Reflex) against a DC of 15 + the trap's
        level. Success allows her to avoid the effects of the trap, while failure
        causes her to suffer them. Regardless, the trap is both revealed and
        sprung -- while some traps work repeatedly, the majority work only once.
        Kobolds sometimes reset some of the traps in the dungeon overnight,
        however. A known, armed trap is represented by the <14><char:GLYPH_TRAP><1>
        symbol, while a sprung or disarmed trap is represented by
        <14><char:GLYPH_DISARMED><1>.\n
        __Traps can be disarmed, dismantled, reset or even set up using the
        Handle Device skill, as described in that skill's writeup. The Jump
        skill can also prove useful for leaping over traps, thereby avoiding
        them -- but a failed Jump roll may cause a character to land on the
        square containing the trap, triggering it!\n\n
        
        <9>States of Being<1>\n
        __A wide variety of physical and mental conditions can bedevil an adventurer
        while exploring the dungeon. Here is a list of some of the most common,
        along with their game-mechanical effects:\n
        __<9>Blind:<1> A blind adventurer can't see. When the character is blind, all
        movable objects are removed from the map, and only the glyph of the player's
        character and her memory of wall and floor squares remain shown -- if you are 
        blind (either naturally or by some effect), your Light, Shadow, Sight and 
        Infravision ranges are all 0. All monsters
        are described as 'something', and no warnings will be given for attacking
        friendly or neutral creatures, walking over traps or hazardous terrain and so
        forth. Blindness negates normal sight and infravision, but not tremorsense,
        blindsight, telepathy, scent or detection magics.\n
        __Blindness can last for a relatively short duration measured in turns, or can
        be a much more serious affliction that can only be cured magically. Fortunately,
        the latter is rare. The Healing skill can be used to treat blindness. Blind
        characters also obviously always suffer the combat penalties for attacking
        unseen creatures, and being attacked by unseen creatures.\n
        __<9>Stunned:<1> Stunned characters suffer a -6 status penalty to Dexterity and
        a -50~ status penalty to attack speed and movement rate. Their spellcasting 
        success chance has a -50~ penalty.\n
        __<9>Confused:<1> Confused characters suffer a -4 status penalty to Intelligence
        and Wisdom, as well as a -75~ modifier to spell success chance. When they try to
        move, they must make a Balance check (DC 18) or move in a randomly selected
        direction instead of their intended one, possibly placing them over dangerous
        terrain.\n
        __<9>Nauseated:<1> A nauseated character suffers the same penalties as a stunned
        one (-6 Dexterity, -50~ Mov/Spd, -50~ spell success) and is additionally unable
        to make attacks until the nausea passes, barring an exceptional Concentration
        score allowing this to be bypassed.\n
        __<9>Fatigued:<1> A fatigued character has spent or lost all their fatigue 
        points. Such a character suffers a -2 fatigue penalty to Strength, Dexterity
        and Charisma, as well as a -10~ penalty to attack speed and movement rate.\n
        __<9>Exhausted:<1> Exhausted is the next stage beyond fatigued; an exhausted
        character has reached a negative total of current fatigue points equal to or
        exceeding their normal positive maximum. Such a character suffers a -6 fatigue
        penalty to Strength, Dexterity and Charisma, as well as a -25~ penalty to
        attack speed and movement rate.\n 
        __<9>Prone:<1> A prone character has been knocked from his feet. He suffers a
        -4 status penalty to his attack rolls and defense class, and he must stand up
        before he is able to move; standing up takes about as much time as making an
        attack, modified by Dexterity -- 25 segments for a character with Dexterity 10.\n
        __<9>Afraid:<1> Afraid characters are unable to make any attacks, and may not
        take movement actions that place them closer to the source of their fear than
        they would otherwise be.\n 
        __<9>Shaken:<1> Being shaken is a lesser form of fear. Shaken characters can
        move and attack freely, but suffer a morale penalty (often -2, but not always)
        to attack rolls, defense class and saving throws.\n\n
        
        <9>Vaults and Complexes<1>\n
        __Some areas of the dungeon are notably more dangerous than others. Complexes
        are regions of closely interconnected rooms. These can be very dangerous,
        because while your character fights the monsters in one room, the monsters
        in nearby rooms can hear you and come to join the melee; thus it is very easy
        to be swamped in such a region -- always have an escape route ready! Complexes
        can appear on any dungeon level, and are not uncommon.
        __Vaults are much rarer and more dangerous, and appear only later in the
        dungeon. Monsters in a vault are held in perfect stasis and cannot act until
        the vault doors are opened or your character (or some other creature from outside
        the vault) enters the vault by some other means. Vaults contain many monsters in
        a small area; far more seriously, the monsters they contain can be far more
        dangerous than those found elsewhere at the same dungeon depth. Vaults only
        occur in the deeper parts of the dungeon.\n\n
        
        <9>Fountains<1>\n
        __Deep below the earth, some natural springs absorb the magical
        radiations of the Underdark. Magical fountains are large, immobile
        magical items built to harness the energy of these springs, usually
        for the purposes of healing or item enchantment. Though useful, these
        magics are deeply chaotic and unpredictable, and using them represents
        a great risk for a significant possible reward.\n
        __To drink from a fountain, use the Quaff ('q') command whilr standing
        on the square that contains the fountain. Drinking from a fountain can 
        be both very beneficial and very risky. When a character drinks, a roll 
        of (1d20 + Luck modifier) is made, with various random, useful or 
        debilitating results; the higher the roll, the more positive the result.
        A high roll can, in increasing order of unlikelyness, restore fatigue, 
        heal wounds, cure diseases, neatralize poisons, restore attribute damage 
        and even remove curses. Low rolls can have very bad effects -- the worst 
        possible effect being possible only if a character has a Luck modifier 
        less than +1, the second worst possible only with a Luck modifier less 
        than +2, and so forth. Characters with very high Luck (such as many
        halflings) can use fountains largely reliably to recover from a wide 
        variety of afflictions.\n
        __Some folks say that dipping magical items in a fountain can increase
        the strength of their enchantment. Perhaps this is true, but it would
        also be a risky endeavor best undertaken only by the Lucky. The greater
        the dungeon depth a fountain is found at, the higher it would be able
        to raise an item's enchantment, relative to the overall power of the
        item. Since fountains are magical items in their own right, they can
        be blessed or cursed, and the exact strength of their dwenomer can be
        determined by identification magic. To dip an item in a fountain, use
        the Dip verb from the Yuse ('y') command.\n\n
        
        <9>LIGHT AND VISION {LV}\n
           ================\n<1>         
        __In Incursion, a character's sensory abilities can be very important
        to her overall survival. There are a number of ways to sense terrain, 
        creatures and objects. At any time your character may have any subset 
        of them.\n\n

        <9>Light Range<1>\n     
        __A light source allows you to see creatures within a certain 
        radius (e.g., 40 feet for a torch or minor magical light,
        60 for a brass lantern). Your light range is increased by
        your lowlight vision, if any (e.g., elves start with 20
        feet of lowlight vision).\n\n 

        <9>Shadow Range<1>\n     
        __Your shadow range is typically twice your base light range. 
        Within it you can see dungeon features (e.g., walls, doors)
        clearly but you see creatures as vague, unidentified
        shadowy forms and you do not see items at all.\n\n

        <9>Sight Range<1>\n     
        __Your sight range is 150 feet, plus 30 feet per point of
        your Wisdom modifier, plus 20 feet per point of Sharp
        Senses. You can see things up to this far away provided
        that they are illuminated for some reason. For example, you
        could see a monster near a wall torch on the other side of
        a great empty chamber within this range. To see a hiding
        creature your Spot skill is contested against its Hide
        skill. Sight is blocked by obscuring terrain (e.g., fog,
        trees).\n\n

        <9>Infravision<1>\n     
        __Your infravision range is determined by your race (usually
        60 feet for most races that have it, or 120 feet for deep
        dwellers like dark elves and gray dwarves). Within this
        range you can see creatures, items and dungeon features
        perfectly. In Incursion, infravision is 'darksight' rather
        than 'heatsight'. Infravision does not automatically
        reveal hiding creatures, you still need a Spot check.
        Infravision is not blocked by light sources. Infravision is
        blocked by obscuring terrain (e.g., fog, trees).\n\n

        <9>Telepathy<1>\n     
        __The telepathy ability allows a character to sense the
        minds of other creatures and thereby determine their nature
        and location, out to a specified range. Within this range 
        you can detect creatures that are neither mindless (such as
        constructs) nor undead. Telepathy does not reveal terrain 
        or items.\n\n

        <9>Tremorsense<1>\n     
        __Tremorsense allows you to sense creatures, terrain and
        items through vibrations in the ground and is commonly
        possessed by magical plants. You can sense all creatures
        within your tremorsense range provided that they are
        neither paralyzed nor flying nor incorporeal nor phased.
        Tremorsense also allows you to detect all solid structures
        (e.g., walls, doors, items) within its radius (based on how
        sound travels through them).\n\n

        <9>Blindsight<1>\n     
        __Blindsight represents a sonar-like aural perception. Within
        your blindsight range you can detect any non-hiding
        creature, or any hiding creature if your skill level in
        Listen is greater than or equal to its skill level in Move
        Silently. You can also detect items and terrain. Creature
        or items inside a field of silence are not detected by
        blindsight. Creatures on a different plane are not detected
        by blindsight. Unlike normal vision, Blindsight is not
        stopped by obscuring terrain (like fog) but it is stopped
        by all solid terrain (even transparent walls of ice). Your
        blindsight range is cut in half if you wear a metal helmet,
        and it is reduced by 1 for every size category greater than
        Tiny of items you are holdin your hand (e.g., a medium
        shield would reduce it by 2).\n\n

        <9>Scent<1>\n     
        __You can detect a creatures within your scent range,
        provided that it is on the same plane as you (e.g., it is
        not ethereal) and that no solid objects are between the two
        of you (e.g., you cannot smell through stone walls). Scent
        does not detect items or terrain.\n\n

        <9>Wizard Sight<1>\n     
        __This magical ability allows you to see everything within
        its range, even through solid walls.\n\n

        <9>Tracking<1>\n     
        __Once you have seen a creature through one of the above
        methods you automatically (if you have the tracking ability --
        usually rangers only) begin to track it. Thereafter, as
        long as it is within your tracking range and too much time
        has not elapsed (depending on your ability level) you can
        sense it. Tracking does not reveal items or terrain.\n\n

        <9>Detection<1>\n     
        __You may also have the ability to detect all creatures or
        (more commonly) a certain creature type within a given
        range. For example, a 1st level paladin can detect evil
        creatures within about 250 feet. It is also possible to
        detect all items or (less commonly) all items of a certain
        type within a given range.\n\n

        <9>Shared Senses<1>\n     
        __If you have a sacred mount or an animal companion, you
        share perceptions. You can sense everything it senses
        and vice-versa. In addition, you are always aware of its
        exact location.\n\n

        <9>Non-Detection<1>\n     
        __Certain cloaking magics or abilities can also hide you from
        the senses of others on a case-by-case basis. For example,
        a ring of mind shielding will prevent telepathy or
        detection from sensing you. Some monsters have natural
        nondetection abilities -- darkmantles cannot be sensed by
        Scent and dark nagas are immune to Telepathy, for example.
        Non-Detection can be very valuable to rogues, because it
        allows them to sneak up on creatures (such as orcs with
        Scent) they could not otherwise surprise.\n\n

        __The option 'Show Perception Modes' will reveal the combination of
        perception modes (e.g., infravision and telepathy) that is allowing you to
        sense a creature using the Look command.\n\n

        __Finally, with one exception the rules are the same for the players and the
        monsters. The exception: monsters with no hands for torches and no other
        perception modes get 60 feet of infravision for free. This usually applies
        to mundane animals (e.g., bison, boa constrictors, ...) that really have no
        place in the dark dungeon but are there for variety and to give druids and
        animal spells something to do. The lack of symmetry is that if you, the
        player, polymorph or wildshape into such a creature you do not get the free
        infravision.\n\n

         <9>TRAINING ATTRIBUTES {TA}\n
            ===================\n<1>
         __Characters in Incursion can gain bonuses to their attributes in
         several ways -- there are spells that boost attributes for a brief
         period of time, and magical items that increase them for as long
         as they are worn. Most of these forms of magic grant a magic bonus
         to an attribute, and are both impermanent and external to the
         character. For this reason (and also because they stack with magic
         bonuses), it's desirable to seek out inherent bonuses to attributes.
         Inherent bonuses represent a growth to the character's internal
         capabilities; once gained, they are permanent and nonmagical. Inherent
         attribute bonuses cannot be dispelled or stolen by circumstance.\n
         __There are several ways to gain inherent bonuses. Rare magical tomes
         might grant them when read, barbarians gain them just for being
         barbarians and advancing in level, and orcs can sometimes gain them
         by devouring the bodies of slain foes. However, the most reliable
         way to gain them is simply through adventuring and development -- as
         a character performs actions which strain and push her attributes,
         she works her way toward higher inherent bonuses. Unlike most types
         of bonuses, inherent bonuses stack with each other -- a single character
         can gain a large inherent bonus from a mixture of training, tomes,
         class features and eating monster corpses. However, there is an
         absolute limit on how high the inherent bonus to a single attribute can
         reach; this limit is +5 for most characters, and +8 for humans.\n\n
         
         <9>Percentile Attributes<1>\n
         __To represent the continued pushing and development of an attribute,
         characters have a percentile score indicating how close they are to
         gaining their next inherent +1 to that attribute. This percentile score
         is listed immediately after the attribute on the character sheet. Actions
         which challenge and leverage the attribute increase this percentile score
         over time. Conversely, it decreases with the passage of time -- every day
         the character rests removes 1d4 points from the percentile score for each
         attribute. Thus, characters who push themselves tend to increase their
         attributes more quickly, while characters who move very slowly and rest
         frequently aren't challenging themselves as harshly and find that their
         attributes do not increase as easily.\n\n
         
         <9>Skills and Training Attributes<1>\n
         __Some skills improve a character's ability to develop her attributes.
         These skills are Athletics, Perform, Concentration and the highest
         Knowledge skill the character has. The character's skill rating is
         subtracted from 100 to determine how many percentile points the
         character must gain in order to merit the gaining of a +1 inherent bonus
         to the attribute in question.\n
         __This is described in greater detail in the writeup to the Athletics
         skill.\n\n
         
         <9>Attribute Development<1>\n
         __Different attributes are challenged in different ways. The following
         actions all have the potential to allow a character to gain percentile
         points to an attribute. Note, however, that there is a finite limit to
         the number of percentile points that can be gained from a given action.
         For example, picking a lock might give a character 3 percentile points
         toward Dexterity, but the most percentile points a character can gain
         from lockpicking is 60, so once she has 60 points from lockpicking, she
         must seek out other sources to increase her Dexterity. Many actions have
         a much lower minimum than this, so characters need diverse activities
         that depend on a given attribute rather than just one activity to gain
         inherent bonuses reliably. Most activities that can be repeated over
         and over again have low maximum point gains, and some activities require
         that they character be at risk (i.e., be near hostile monsters) when she
         performs them, otherwise they merit no gain.\n\n

         <3>General<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Succeeding in a saving throw trains the attribute that modifies
         that save -- Constitution for Fortitude, Dexterity for Reflex and Wisdom
         for Will. The degree of gain is based on the save DC.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Succeeding in a skill check trains the attributes associated with
         that skill; again, the degree of gain is based on the skill check DC. Some
         skills train attributes more strongly in a single use than others.\n
         
         \n
         <3>Strength<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Kicking open a door in a single try trains Strength.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Scoring a critical hit with a weapon larger than you, or with a
         weapon of your size wielded two-handed, trains Strength.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Succeeding in a grapple check against a creature stronger than
         you trains Strength, provided you are not using Escape Artist but are
         depending on Strength for the grapple.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Working at a forge to create or repair metal items trains Strength.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Digging tunnels in the dungeon with the Mining skill trains Strength
         very heavily.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Tearing free once you become stuck (in some types of terrain or the
         effects of a <9>web<1> spell, for example) trains Strength.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Adventuring while your encumbrance is Heavy trains strength; doing so
         while it is Extreme trains it even further.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Adventuring while wearing heavy armour trains both Strength and
         Constitution, but abuses Dexterity.\n
         \n
         <3>Dexterity<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Tumbling trains Dexterity.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Using the Evasion, Defensive Roll or Flawless Dodge abilities successfully
         trains Dexterity.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Being missed by monsters while Fighting Defensively trains Dexterity.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Scoring critical hits with a Light weapon trains Dexterity.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Using thrown weapons can train Dexterity even if you don't score a crit.\n
         \n
         <3>Constitution<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Overcoming poison or disease trains Constitution.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Surviving a critical hit from an enemy trains Constitution.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Eating foods specially designated as healthy (relative to your race)
         trains Constitution. Most rations aren't healthy -- they're made to last a long
         time, not be nutritious -- and rotten food is never healthy.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Staying Content or Peckish trains Constitution weakly. Staying Hungry trains
         Constitution if you have the Fasting class ability. However, starvation abuses
         Constitution, as does being Satiated (weakly) or Bloated (strongly).\n
         __<3>*<1>_Spending fatigue points through conscious actions trains Constitution.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Adventuring while wearing heavy armour trains both Strength and
         Constitution, but abuses Dexterity.\n
         \n
         <3>Intelligence<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Successfully casting a spell with a base success chance of 60~ while
         threatened trains Intelligence; if the base chance is 30~ or lower, Intelligence 
         is trained more strongly.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Successfully using metamagic while threatened also trains Intelligence,
         based on the number of metamagic levels used.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Identifying items via experimentation trains Intelligence.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Identifying monsters with Sense Motive trains Intelligence.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Doing research in a library trains Intelligence strongly.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Reading scrolls successfully trains Intelligence.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Creating magical, alchemical or mundane items, or repairing
         items, trains Intelligence.\n
         \n
         <3>Wisdom<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Successfully turning or commanding undead (or other creatures) trains 
         Wisdom.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Praying and receiving a divine blessing trains Wisdom.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Angering your god or violating his edicts abuses Wisdom.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Trying to resolve conflict with other creatures trains Wisdom, whether
         it is successful or not.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Donating money to priests or charity (in the cities in the full release
         game) trains Wisdom for a good-aligned character and abuses it for an evil
         character.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Creating magical items trains Wisdom.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Converting an altar trains Wisdom strongly.\n
         \n
         <3>Charisma<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Performing a social action -- cowing, quelling, taunting, etc. creatures
         -- trains Charisma. This falls under skill use (noted under general, above), but it
         is worth noting specifically here as well.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Causing creatures to be charmed or to become afraid with magic trains
         Charisma.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Summoning creatures trains Charisma.\n
         __<3>*<1>_If an evil character kills a frightened creature, this adds to her 
         reputation as a fearsome force to be reckoned with, and trains her Charisma.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Sitting in a throne trains Charisma.\n
         \n
         <3>Luck<1>\n
         __<3>*<1>_Adventuring at a dungeon depth higher than your character level trains
         luck -- it's dangerous and involves great risk-taking!\n
         __<3>*<1>_Using an item with a random effect (such as a <9>wand of wonder<1>) and
         getting a beneficial effect trains Luck.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Using a magical fountain and gaining a beneficial effect trains Luck.\n
         __<3>*<1>_Surviving a critical hit from an enemy trains Luck.\n\n
         
         <9>ALIGNMENT AND CONDUCT {AC}\n
            =====================\n<1>
         __In Incursion, as in many systems inspired by the OGL system,
         alignment is used as a tool for measuring a character's morals and
         ethics along two distinct axis: good vs. evil and law vs. chaos.
         Incursion characters choose their alignment at the beginning of
         the game, subject to certain restrictions based on their choice
         of class and diety. Actions taken later in the game can cause an
         invoulantary change in a character's alignment.\n\n
         
         <9>DESIRED ALIGNMENT<1>\n
         __Intent matters. An evil character can freely donate money to
         the poor without any chance of her alignment changing -- why
         shouldn't she, if it will improve her reputation and allow her
         to acclimate more power in the long run? While some actions 
         carry a weight in terms of alignment regardless of the intent
         behind them -- for example, killing innocent people always
         draws a character closer to an Evil alignment -- for other
         actions this is not the case.\n
         __Therefore, Incursion requires a player to state the alignment
         that their character <9>desires<1> to embody, as well as telling
         him into which alignment his character's actions actually place
         said character. Thus, an evil character <9>who desires to be
         good<1> and donates money to the needy will find his alignment
         changing, whereas one who is content to be evil will not.\n
         __At the beginning of the game, the player chooses her character's
         alignment, and that choice is assumed to be her desired alignment
         as well. When a character's desired alignment comes into variance
         with her actual alignment, the player can select the 'A'lignment
         option on the character sheet to choose a new desired alignment.
         Her actual alignment does not change at all when this choice is
         made, but the game will evaluate all of her further actions in
         light of the new alignment she is trying to live up to.\n\n
         
         <9>COSMOLOGICAL FORCES<1>\n
         __Good, evil, law and chaos are not merely philosophical ideals in
         the world of Incursion; instead, they are concrete and tangible
         metaphysical forces with direct supernatural effects on the world.
         A magical sword wounds Chaotic creatures especially deeply, a warding
         circle might keep out only Evil creatures, and so forth.\n
         __Certain spells and magical items are inherently good, evil, lawful
         or chaotic. Using items of this nature that conflict with a character's
         alignment will inevitably draw that character toward the item's 
         alignment, even if the item is used in a manner that otherwise reflects
         the character's normal alignment -- using an unholy sword to kill an
         evil creature strengthens the force of the unholy in the world, and is
         therefore an evil act.\n\n
         
         <9>GOOD<1>\n
         __Incursion defines goodness as being a respect for life and virtue
         combined with the courage and altruism needed to protect the innocent
         from harm. Good characters protect the weak, respect other good
         characters, seek to redeem evil and bring about justice and improve
         the quality of life of all feeling creatures.\n
         __Good and evil are opposing forces, but are not mirror images of each
         other; they are very different in nature. Good characters face a great
         many restrictions on their actions, while evil characters face very
         few or none. Good is harder than evil. Conversely, however, good 
         characters find advantages in that other good creatures will not be
         as likely to be hostile to them and will be more willing to deal
         fairly with them or even offer selfless aid -- after all, their cause
         is good. Good characters also benefit from holy items more than evil
         characters benefit from unholy ones, because good character most
         typically fight against evil monsters, while evil character most
         typically also fight evil monsters, or fight amongst themselves.\n
         __A good alignment is strengthened by killing inherently evil creatures
         such as demons and devils, healing neutral creatures and giving gold to
         the needy. The following acts contravene a good alignment:\n
         __<3>*<1> Good characters must not hurt or kill non-hostile creatures, even
         evil ones. Good characters are expected to show regard for the lives
         of others.\n
         __<3>*<1> Good character should not make use of acid attacks against
         living creatures -- Incursion considers acid to be a sadistic form
         of attack employed by those with more interest in inflicting pain
         and mutilating their foes than disposing of them to protect the
         world.\n
         __<3>*<1> Good characters should not steal from non-evil characters,
         though stealing impacts the law/chaos side of the alignment scale more
         strongly than the good/evil one.\n
         __<3>*<1> Good characters should not recruit evil creatures to join
         their party freely.\n
         __<3>*<1> Good characters should not use spells or magical items
         designed specifically to summon demons or devils, or other items
         or spells that are unholy or have the [Evil] descriptor.\n\n
         __<3>*<1> Good characters should not pray evil gods.\n
         __<3>*<1> Using the Exploitation ability of the Bluff skill in an
         act contrary to a Good alignment.\n 
         __<3>*<1> Only good characters who worship Mara can animate the
         dead without it being considered an evil act as a result of desecrating
         the bodies of the dead; Mara teaches rituals and philosophies that
         allow this to be done respectfully.\n\n
         
         <9>EVIL<1>\n
         __In the context of a character's alignment, evil is the absence of
         morals, or more accurately the absence of <9>correct<1> morals --
         some Evil characters have very complex, deluded codes of moral
         conduct. Combined with this is often selfishness -- the desire to
         put one's own well-being above that of others, and to injure,
         victimize or exploit others in order to better oneself.\n
         __In Incursion, evil characters have less restrictions on their
         actions, but find that they lack for support and are surrounded by
         enemies. The Bluff skill is very valuable to evil characters,
         because it allows them to conceal their evil nature -- without
         Bluff, the game assumes that other creatures will have heard about
         the character's treacherous or hateful acts, and Good creatures
         will thus be more likely to be hostile.\n
         __There are no restrictions on the actions an evil character can
         take in Incursion based on the Evil component of their alignment 
         alone. If an evil character commits good acts based on a desire
         to become good (as defined by their desired alignment), they will
         slowly, over time, become good. If a character's desired alignment
         is evil, however, no amount of good acts will change it, since the
         game assumes they are all being done with selfish motives.\n\n
                  
         <9>LAW<1>\n
         __A lawful alignment represents the belief that a structured society
         is beneficial and as such, the character is obligated to follow the 
         standards set down by society. Lawful neutral characters follow laws
         with the best interests of their society in mind, lawful good characters
         follow laws with the best interests of all societies even theoretically
         capable of good in mind, and lawful evil characters preserve the laws
         of society because they recognize them as the root of their own power.
         The dominant society of Theyra emphasizes a code of conduct based on 
         chivalty, warrior's honour, respect for the structure of the class system 
         and support for the community as a whole, as strongly influenced by the f
         aith of Immotian.\n
         __The following actions contravene a Lawful alignment:\n
         __<3>*<1> Poison can fell even the strongest warrior, and thus has the
         potential to disrupt the hierarchy of power; as such, its use is an
         unlawful act. Drow are an exempt from this stricture, as poisonings are
         considered to be part of the proper order of their society.\n
         __<3>*<1> Attacking cowering or fleeing people is considered to be a
         base act and a strong breach of honour, and condemned accordingly. If
         terms have been offered and refused, however, a fugitive can be
         slain lawfully.\n
         __<3>*<1> Attacking creatures who have surrendered to you is also a
         deeply treacherous act that goes against the law of war.\n
         __<3>*<1> Attacking prone, paralyzed or stuck characters is similarly
         considered to be base behaviour. Characters with rogue levels are
         exempt from this restriction.\n
         __<3>*<1> Eating the flesh of humanoid creatures is considered to be
         an unlawful act, even if the victim is a goblinoid or other kind of
         creature not considered a person under law. Cannibalism is an especially
         serious form of this. Orcs can eat other orcs without suffering any
         penalty, due to the unique standards of their society -- eating a
         fallen foe is considered an honourable act, because their soul lives
         on within you and shares in your glories.\n
         __<3>*<1> Stealing from those legally considered 'people' is always an 
         unlawful act, regardless of the victim's alignment.\n
         __<3>*<1> Lawful characters normally should not recruit chaotic creatures 
         to join their party freely; however, lawful good creatures can associate 
         with chaotic good freely -- the commonality of good overrides a lawful
         loyalty in this circumstance.\n\n
         
         <3>The Code of Chivalry<1>\n
         __In addition to the normal requirements of a lawful alignment, certain
         characters are required to adhere to the standards of fair combat as set
         out in the Theyran code of chivalry: not attacking prone, paralyzed,
         stuck or blinded opponents. The rules of chivalry do not apply to all
         combatants -- the Theyran nobility would never hobble their armies that
         way. Instead, they only apply to characters considered to be knights or
         participants in noble combat under law: paladins, worshippers of Erich
         and characters who are either mounted or wearing heavy armour (which is
         traditionally reserved for nobles).\n
         
         <3>The Applicability of Law<1>\n
         __Most of Theyra has different standards as to who is awarded the protection
         of law. In the mainstream human/halfling dominated society, demihumans are considered
         people by law; goblinoids are not. Lawful Neutral and Lawful Evil characters
         follow the law as it is, the latter interpreting it more in the benefit of
         keeping the peasants down and the former more impartially. Lawful Good
         characters interpret the law as it should be in an objectively good
         society, meaning all the restrictions applied to demihumans, they must
         instead apply to all sapient beings.\n
         __Likewise, to goblinoids, only other goblinoids are considered people;
         the lizardfolk, however, recognize all thinking beings as people, just
         as lawful good characters must.\n
         __Inherently evil creatures -- fiends, energy-draining undead and so
         forth -- are recognized as inherently destructive to all societies, and
         no society (other than devils) awards such beings protection under
         law.\n\n
         
         <9>CHAOS<1>\n
         __A chaotic alignment represents a belief in individual freedom and liberty
         being more important than the needs of society. Chaotic characters have
         little regard for law, instead following personal codes of ethics. Chaotic
         evil characters only recognize the validity of their own freedom, and thus
         essentially do whatever they want; chaotic neutral characters respect the freedom
         of all thinking creatures as sacrosanct, and are forbidden from acts which
         contravene that freedom. Chaotic good characters go one step further, being
         willing to fight selflessly to defend the liberties of others.\n
         __The following acts contravene a chaotic good or chaotic neutral alignment
         along the law/chaos axis:\n
         __<3>*<1> Chaotic characters should not use magic with the Compulsion
         descriptor against sapient creatures under any circumstances. This includes
         spells like <9>dominate person<1> and magical items like the <9>Medallion
         of Mental Domination<1>.\n
         __<3>*<1> The trade guilds and merchant cartels on Theyra are deeply
         corrupt, imposing and economic tyrrany that reinforces the class system by
         any means available. As such, while trade itself is acceptable to chaotic
         characters, they should not buy or sell items to merchants affiliated with
         the guilds, such as Roark Ironbeard.\n
         __<3>*<1> Chaotic creatures should not invite lawful neutral or lawful evil
         creatures to join their group, because these creatures oppress others as a
         part of their normal methodology.\n
         __<3>*<1> Chaotic characters should not coerce non-evil creatures by using the
         Intimidate skill to Cow or Issue Requests. They are free to negotiate with
         them using Diplomacy or to trick them with Bluff, however. Barbarians and
         orcs are exempt from the Cow restriction of the chaotic alignment.\n\n
         
         <9>CHANGING ALIGNMENT<1>\n
         __When you desire to change alignment and have stated a new alignment,
         you must begin working up a tally of acts in favour of that alignment.
         The presence of inherently aligned creatures in Incursion is especially
         valuable for this purpose. Killing an inherently aligned creature such
         as a demon or modron when you desire the opposite alignment will move
         you closer to your desired alignment. Killing any hostile creature of 
         opposing alignment is useful in moving toward a new alignment, but 
         risking your life to kill an inherently aligned creature is far more 
         valuable than doing so to kill a mortal being whose alignment simply
         happens to oppose your own.\n\n
                  
         <9>ALIGNMENT BONUSES<1>\n
         __Holding to a specific alignment can be very
         difficult, but the very conviction that fuels
         it gives a character strength. All bonuses
         derived from alignment vary in magnitude based
         on the strength of the character's devotion to
         that component of his alignment.\n
         __Good characters are deeply offended by cruelty,
         hatred and narrow-minded malice, and that righteous
         anger bleeds through when they enter combat: they
         receive a morale bonus to hit evil creatures, or a
         bonus to the save DC of spells cast at evil creatures.\n
         __Lawful characters follow a strict code of conduct
         imposed by society, and in so doing develop a greater
         degree of self-discipline and focus than other
         characters, allowing them to devote their will more
         fully to improving themselves -- they receive a small
         bonus to experience gained upon reaching character 
         level 3.\n
         __Chaotic characters believe in the freedom of the
         individual and the sacred value of liberty, and these
         values give them a greater strength when fighting to
         resist coercion: they receive a morale bonus to their
         Will saving throw.\n
         __Evil characters receive no special bonuses, but then
         also have few or no restrictions on their actions.
         Chaotic evil characters receive the chaotic bonus without
         having to adhere to the normal chaotic restrictions, but
         have a corresponding penalty: they have difficulty
         inspiring trust in others due to their vicious,
         treacherous and often randomly cruel behaviour.
         Allied creatures are much more likely to turn
         on a chaotic evil associate than they are to turn
         on a neutral evil one, who can use the structure
         of society, trust and honour to ease others' fears
         when it benefits him to do so.\n\n   
                  
         <9>PRAYER AND ALTARS {PA}\n
            =================\n<1>
         __Incursion makes use of a fairly complicated system of religion
         wherein players can devote themselves to one or more gods and in
         so doing gain blessings both in the form of emergency aid and more
         lasting, long-term divine gifts. The system of prayer and worship 
         is one of very few aspects of Incursion that is not entirely 
         transparent to the player, by design.\n\n

         <9>Choosing a God<1>\n
         __Characters in Incursion can make sacrifices to, and receive
         blessings from, more than one god. However, they must choose one
         specific god (or none) to devote themselves to. This chosen god
         is the one who will answer any prayers they make when they are
         not standing over an altar; to receive aid or blessings from any
         other god requires access to the appropriate altar.\n
         __Certain classes -- priests, paladins and monks -- begin
         play devoted to a specific god which they will be allowed to choose
         at character creation. All gods have priests, whereas paladins and 
         monks may follow only a subset of the available gods in the game;
         druids also have a restricted selection of gods available, even
         though they do not start play devoted to a diety.        
         Converting in play to a different religion will prevent the player
         from advancing further in these classes until he switches back to a
         god suitable to the class in question. Monks may follow Aiswin, Essiah,
         Hesani, Immotion, Mara, the Multitude or Xavias. Druids may follow
         Essiah, Hesani, Kysul, Mara, Maeve, Sabine, Xel or Zurvash. Paladins
         may follow Ekliazeh, Erich, Immotian, Kysul, Mara, Semirath or
         Xavias.\n
         __Characters from other classes normally do not start affiliated with
         a god, having to convert in gameplay. However, dwarves and orcs have
         the elective of worshipping Ekliazeh or Khasrach respectively if they
         choose a class that does not offer a choice of gods. Elves begin play
         worshipping Maeve if they choose an irreligious class; if they receive
         a choice of gods from their class and do not pick Maeve, they begin the
         game with her angry at them.\n
         __<9>Personal Conversion:<1> Characters who do not have a god, or wish to convert
         to a god other than the one they presently worship, must find an altar
         attuned to the desired diety. They then pray while standing in the same
         square as an altar, and if asked choose to pray to the altar's diety rather
         than their current one. Most gods have alignment restrictions, and some have
         racial or other restrictions. Furthermore, no god will accept a petitioner
         whom she is angry at. Finally, some gods require followers to accrue a
         certain minimum level of favour with them before allowing a petitioner to
         convert; this favour is lost upon conversion. If all the requirements are
         met, the character is not a devoted follower of the altar's god, and can
         pray to that god without needing an altar.\n\n
         
         <9>Altars<1>\n
         __In the world of Incursion, an altar is not just a symbolic adornment,
         but instead a powerful and sacred magical item that acts as a conduit
         between the mortal world and the realms of the gods. The gods of the
         Theyran pantheon are, in a way, not unlike vampires: they can only go
         where they are invited. A god can exercise divine power in the world in
         only one of two circumstances: through an altar or through a petitioner
         (or ex-petitioner) who has interacted with them using an altar. This
         makes praying at an altar a very dangerous choice: a paladin, for example,
         can slaughter the followers of an evil god and the god will be impotent
         to act directly, but if the paladin prays to that evil god and then turns
         away, the god will be considered involved in the paladin's life; the link
         is forged and the god can send negative interventions to the paladin
         forevermore. Maeve is always considered to be 'involved' with elves, who
         are taught to pray at her altars from early childhood. Certain methods of
         breaking this involvement exist, such as the <9>contact other plane<1>
         spell.\n\n
         __<9>Altar Conversion:<1> Having an altar to one's patron god close by is
         a powerful advantage: it allows a character to bless items, create holy
         water and make sacrifices to improve one's standing with the diety in
         question. However, altars are not always easily available; for this reason,
         an adventurer may want to convert an altar discovered in the dungeon into
         an altar to her own god. Doing this requires a complex theological ritual
         that takes 4 hours and drains 2 faitgue points.\n
         __Converting an altar requires two rolls. The first in a Knowledge (Theology)
         check against DC 15 to see if the ritual is performed correctly. If this
         check is failed, the time and fatigue is lost, but nothing else occurs and
         the attempt may be made again. The second roll represents a contest of the
         petitioner's faith against the altar's current god, and is represented in
         the game by a 1d20 roll, to which is added the petitioner's Favour Level
         with her god (rated from 0 to 10) and her Wisdom modifier, against a DC of
         15. If the altar's current god is friendly to the petitioner's god, and is
         also not a jealous god, he may choose to cede the altar, granting a +4 bonus
         to the conversion roll. Otherwise, he will surely become angry at the
         petitioner whether the conversion succeeds or fails, and will strike back
         with potentially lethal vengeance!\n
         __If the conversion check succeeds, the altar is converted into an altar
         to the petitioner's god. If the check fails, but still exceeds DC 12, the
         altar remains as it was. If the check result is 11 or lower, the altar
         will explode, vanishing and inflicting 2d10 blunt damage and 2d10 fire
         damage to the petitioner.\n\n
         
         <9>Sacrifice and Favour<1>\n
         __A character's stature in their god's eyes is measured by a quantity
         called favour. The player cannot directly see her character's favour rating,
         but internally to the game it functions in much the same way as experience
         points do. Favour can be gained in a number of ways specific to a given
         god -- Asherath appreuciates winning difficult fights, Erich approves of
         the slaughter of goblinoids, Hesani likes characters resolving conflicts
         -- but the most common way to gain favour with a diety is to offer
         sacrifices to that diety.\n
         __Most of the gods of Theyra, good and evil,
         accept blood sacrifices made at their altars; those that do not typically
         accept some items as sacrifices instead. Each god has very specific rules
         on what constitutes an acceptable sacrifice to them; only Asherath does
         not take any kind of altar sacrifices whatsoever. Making a sacrifice 
         requires an altar, and the sacrifice can only be made to the god the
         altar is associated with.\n
         __The system of sacrifice and favour in Incursion is designed to avoid
         repetition and monotony while still providing a strong challenge. Each
         god has (on average) six 'slots' to receive sacrifices in, each with a
         weight assigned to it. Erich, for
         example, has four slots: one for dragons, one for beasts, one for
         chaotic humanoids and one for evil outsiders, with the dragons and
         outsiders being weighed at double what beasts and chaotic humanoids
         are. Essiah, on the other hand, has two slots for creatures that
         represent a perversion of sexuality and three slots for general evil
         creatures; the perversions, being far rarer, are weighted much more
         heavily than generic evil creatures. The value of
         a sacrificed creature is usually based on its Challenge Rating and the 
         value of a sacrificed item is based on its market value. The favour with 
         a god that a character receives from sacrifice is based on the best 
         possible sacrifces fit into those slots, so quality of sacrifices matters
         whereas, by and large, quantity does not. When a character makes a sacrifice
         it is placed in the slot where it would grant the most favour; weak 
         sacrifices never over-write stronger ones, which means that if all
         suitable slots are filled with better sacrifices, a new sacrifice will
         not increase a character's favour at all. When a sacrifice increases favour,
         the game will tell you that the god is 'impressed'; when it is a suitable
         sacrifice but does not increase favour, the god will be 'satisfied'.\n
         __In order to make a sacrifice, a character must carry a creature's corpse
         to the altar; as a result of this, Strength plays a part in gaining divine
         favour, by design. However, for very weak characters, and for gods who
         favour the sacrifice of creatures that do not normally leave corpses (such
         as the Multitude, who favour incorporeal undead sacrifices), there is an
         alternative. If a creature is slain while it is standing exactly on a
         square containing an altar, that creature will automatically be considered
         to a a sacrifice to the altar's god by its killer. This is referred to as
         <9>live sacrifice<1>; it can be very difficult to conduct, but also very
         rewarding in terms of favour. Note that live sacrifice occurs any time a
         player character kills a creature standing on an altar, even if the player
         may not want to offer a sacrifice to that altar's god; this can make live
         sacrifice very much a double-edged sword!\n
         __When a god is angry, a suitable sacrifice can also be used as a form of
         penitence, lessening or removing completely the divine anger. Suitable
         sacrifices made to an angry god do not increase favour, instead lessening
         the god's anger. Sacrifices made to decrease anger do not have to be potent
         enough to increase favour, but they do have to be notable relative to the
         character level of the character making them.\n
         __<9>Favour Levels and Permanent Blessings:<1> When characters make sacrifices 
         (or gain favour, for gods that do not accept sacrifices), their total favour 
         is recalculated and compared to an internal favour table specific to each god. 
         This table works much like the experience table, determining a character's 
         favour level. If the total is enough for them to be at a higher favour level
         than they are, the god in question will grant them a permanent blessing. This
         works in many ways like gaining a level in a prestige class: the character
         gains certain special abilities for their new favour level, though favour does
         not grant base qualities such as BAB, hit dice or saving throw modifiers.
         There are ten levels of favour possible with each god; characters can only be
         raised above the third level of favour with the god they have specifically
         devoted themselves to. Your current level of favour with your god is
         indicated by a line on the 'Spiritual State' section of the character
         sheet, as follows:\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] is noncommital.' (no favour level)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] has noticed your worship.' (level 1)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] is cautiously pleased with your worship.' (level 2)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] is pleased with your worship.' (level 3)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] is very pleased with your worship.' (level 4)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'[God] is exalted by your worship.' (level 5)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'You are a minor champion of [God].' (level 6)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'You are a champion of [God].' (level 7)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'You are among the greatest of [God]'s champions.' (level 8)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'You are the hand of [God] on Theyra.' (level 9)\n
         __<3>*<1>_'You have been crowned by [God].' (level 10)\n
         __At present, the highest level of favour one can receive with a god
         is favour level 9; characters will be able to be crowned in <9>Return of
         the Forsaken<1>. Also note that it is, by design, considerably harder to 
         attain favour level 9 with many gods than it is to defeat Murgash and
         beat the game!\n\n
         
         <9>Conduct and Penance<1>\n
         __Every god places upon her followers a specific standard of behaviour
         they are expected to adhere to. Violating this code of conduct will
         first displease the god; when displeased, your god will not act
         spontaneously on your behalf to bestow blessings, though they will
         still bail you out of trouble (as much as they usually would, anyway)
         when you pray for aid. Once transgressions cross a certain line,
         however, the god will be fully angered,
          making it impossible to receive aid from her and causing
         her to send negative interventions instead of positive. The specific
         rules that each god places before her followers are listed in the
         'Worship' section of each god's writeup. Some rules may apply only to
         those who devote themselves to the diety in question, while others apply
         to everyone. All the gods are omniscient, silently watching all people
         on Theyra, though they are impotent to act upon the lives of anyone who
         hasn't prayed to them, they still note the acts that all people take,
         and form opinions accordingly.\n
         __The message <9>'You feel uneasy.'<1> signifies that your patron god
         is displeased with your acts; no such message is given, however, when any
         other god becomes angry.\n
         __When a god who is involved in a character's life becomes angry, that
         diety will send negative interventions to trouble the character. When
         a character is devoted to a god and angers them, they must soothe the
         anger by making sacrifices. When a different involved god becomes angry,
         the anger may be soothed over time, but will also dissipate after a
         number of negative interventions depending upon the strength of the
         anger. Some gods are more tolerant, and will grant worshippers a certain
         lattitude in violating their rules before they are counted as being
         angry; others are very strict and will become angry at even a single
         transgression.\n
         __It is possible for repeated transgressions without atonement to make
         one's patron god so angry that they will reject the character utterly,
         stripping all their blessings from her and leaving her to fend for
         herself, usually also consistantly sending negative interventions
         against her without surcease.\n
         __<9>'Risk-Taking':<1> Some gods grant favour or become angry on the
         basis of the degree of risk aversion or patience a follower shows.
         This manifests in game terms by gauging the characer level a character
         reaches before descending to a given dungeon level. The baseline is
         that a character's level will be two higher than the dungeon level
         she is on, so a character who has to avoid being overly cautious
         should descend to dungeon level 2 before reaching character level
         4, while a character who does not want to be seen as impatient or
         reckless should not descend to dungeon level 2 <9>until<1> she
         reaches character level 4. Characters are never penalizing for
         being on dungeon level 1, and likewise are never penalized if their
         character level is maxed out.\n\n
         
         <9>Divine Relations<1>\n
         __The pantheon of Theyra has complex dynamics among itself; some members
         are close friends and allies, while others are bitter enemies. Characters
         can pray to any god, given a suitable altar, as well as making sacrifces
         and receiving aid and blessings. Some gods offer very useful services to
         characters who do not worship them directly: Immotian will cure diseases,
         Xavias can identify items and so forth. However, praying to a god other
         than your patron can anger your patron if the god you are praying to is
         not an ally of your patron. The relations between gods can be gleaned
         through experimentation, but are often obvious from common sense simply 
         as a result of reading the various gods' writeups.\n\n
         
         <9>Seeking Insight<1>\n
         __Characters will always be offered the option to
         seek insight when they pray; this allows them to learn about their
         standing with a given god. Seeking insight is never an aligned act,
         nor do gods react to it in any way. It is 'safe'. Successfully gleaning
         insight requires a Knowledge (Theology) skill check against DC 15.
         Success reveals whether the god is question is angry, how they would
         aid you in a time of need and how strongly they favour you. If the check
         is failed, it can be re-attempted after resting.\n
         __Some gods will also identify some or all magical items as divine
         aid when a follower seeks insight. The game will ask whether you want
         to seek insight into your possessions when you seek insight in general;
         if you do the god you pray to will identify some or all of your items,
         with all the normal penalties for receiving divine aid.\n
         
         <9>Divine Aid<1>\n
         __Any character devoted to a specific diety can pray for divine aid
         from that god at any time. Prayers for aid on Theyra are very ritual
         and complex, and structure and correct enunciation are necessary to
         allow a god to aid a petitioner without an altar to act as a conduit.
         As such, to have a prayer for aid answered, a character must make a
         successful Knowledge (Theology) check. The DC varies between 8 and 15
         depending on how exacting and ritualistic the faith of the god in
         question is.\n
         __Each of the gods in Incursion grants several
         different forms of aid; sometimes gods will only grant aid depending
         upon how severe a situation is (for example, only healing the character
         if she is severely wounded, or only teleporting her away if she is
         badly outnumbered); furthermore, most gods require characters to
         attain a certain level of favour before they will give specific forms
         of aid to the character. A character can learn exactly what forms of
         aid are available to them at present by using the seek insight option
         on the pray command. Each god writeup lists the forms of aid a diety
         is capable of giving, whereas the insight option will tell you what
         your diety would be willing to give you now, at your current level of
         favour.\n 
         __There are many different forms of divine aid; most are self-explanatory
         based on their message in the seek insight results. <9>Clearing you mind<1>
         refers to removing stunning, confusion, enchantment and paralysis, and also
         allowing the character to see invisible creatures if she is currently being
         menaced by them, while
         <9>purifying the body<1> refers to curing poison, disease, petrificaton
         and paralysis. <9>Replenishing your spirit<1>, conversely, restores all
         drained experience and heals all attribute damage. <9>Deflecting lethal
         blows<1> indicates that the god will intercede automatically to lessen
         the damage from a critical hit that would kill the player or leave her
         with less than 1/5th of her normal hit points. This reduces the hit to
         non-critical damage level, but does not add to prayer timeout.\n
         __Divine aid comes with a price, however; the gods help those who help
         themselves, and bless most highly those servants who call upon their
         aid only rarely. Whenever you pray and receive aid (or are protected
         from a crit), a percentile penalty is applied to your total favour with the diety
         in question, culmulative with all such penalties in the past. Your favour 
         level never goes down, but the more you rely on divine aid, the harder 
         it becomes to gain further permanent blessings from your god. This
         penalty can never exceed 100~; if receiving aid would make it do so,
         your god is no longer able to give you aid. Some gods lower this penalty
         whenever you gain a character level as a kind of 'aid allowance', while 
         others do not. In Wizard Mode, you can see this penalty listed in the
         Spiritual State section of the character sheet.\n
         __Furthermore, the gods can offer aid only infrequently; when a player
         calls upon a god's aid, they will not be able to receive further aid
         for a pre-set time period, referred to as a <9>prayer timeout<1>. This
         period varies from god to god; a player can determine if they currently
         are in a prayer timeout using the seek insight option. Prayer timeout is
         measured in 'XP clicks' -- individual instances of the character gaining
         (any amount of) experience -- and as a result it cannot be 'waited out'; 
         the player will have to continue adventuring to run out the prayer 
         timeout and again be eligable to receive divine aid.\n
         __<9>Resurrection:<1> For an especially favoured servant, the gods will
         even raise the dead. This is essentially just a special case of divine
         aid; it is received when a character dies rather than when she prays
         for aid. In addition to the normal minimum favour requirement, characters
         must be of a certain minimum character level (determined by their god)
         to be important enough to be resurrected. Resurrection usually carries
         a stiffer percentile favour penalty than other forms of divine aid.\n
         __A resurrected character loses a full character level and re-appears
         on the first level of the dungeon with a limited supply of emergency
         equipment and a new, fully healed body. Their normal equipment remains 
         with their corpse at the location they died, unless the monsters they
         were fighting pick it up and make use of it. A character can theoretically
         be raised in this manner any number of times, provided that doing so will 
         not put her favour penalty above 100~. However, there is a chance that a 
         character will not survive repeated resurrections...\n\n
         
         <9>Blessing Items<1>\n
         __Characters with at least minimal favour with a god can also use an altar to 
         bless items. To do this, drop one or more items on the altar, pray and select 
         the blessing option. The items will glow with a silvery light, and become blessed.
         This, like resurrection, is a specialized form of divine aid, and increases
         the character's percentile penalty to favour by one percent for each item
         so blessed. Blessing a stack of items accords a penalty of 1~ plus 1~ per
         five items in the stack.\n
         __Characters with stronger favour with their god may be able to have a weapon
         divinely enchanted with a special quality specific to the god in question.
         Mara, for example, favours keen weapons, whereas Immotian favours flaming ones.
         Whether this occurs depends on the petitioner's favour level with the altar's
         god, the petitioner's Wisdom modifier, the power of the quality and the depth 
         the item would typically be found at: it's harder for a god to grant a quality
         to a +5 sword than to a +1 sword. Gods are more favourable to enchanting their
         chosen weapons; conversely, some qualities cannot belong to some weapons: only
         bladed weapons can be keen, for example.\n\n
         
         <9>Divine Interventions<1>\n
         __In addition to sending divine aid when implored by an adventurer, the
         gods all (except Asherath) interact with their mortal followers on their
         own initiative. When a character has a god angry at her, she will receive
         negative interventions; when she is in favour with her diety, she will
         instead receive beneficial interventions. (Maeve is something of an
         capricious exception, being fond of doing obnoxious things to her
         followers even if they haven't done anything to anger her, and conversely
         rarely doing beneficial things for followers who have angered her.) 
         The player has no control over when these interventions occur; they
         are timed with 'xp clicks' and randomness in the same manner as the
         prayer timeout described above.\n
         __Every god has different interventions. Erich is famous for giving his
         followers magical arms and armour when pleased with them, while Kysul
         shows anger by causing her followers' bodies to decompose!\n\n

          <9>ALLIES AND LEADERSHIP {AL}\n
            =====================\n<1>         
          __Your character need not face the rigors of the dungeon alone. Characters
          with strong social skills can recruit aid to fight at their side in the
          dungeon -- convincing neutral monsters they encounter to join their party,
          or even turning foes neutral, then recruiting them as a two-step process.
          Sapient beings can be recruited with the Diplomacy skill, while animals (and
          with the right feats, other beasts) can be recruited using the Animal
          Empathy skill.\n\n
              
          <9>Party CR (PCR)<1>\n
          __In Incursion, by default a player character can lead a party with a total
          Challenge Rating equal to her own character level, adjusted by her Charisma
          modifier. A single creature has a Challenge Rating equal to its effective
          level as shown in its monster memory page, whereas multiple creatures have
          a calculated total challenge rating that makes their strength equivalent to
          a single creature of the same CR.\n
          __(For the curious, the CR of a group is calculated as being the cube root
          of the sum of all the cubed CRs of each creature in the party. Don't worry
          too much about this, though -- you don't need to follow the math, and the
          game blurs the rules in some places to get sensible results anyway.)\n
          __Certain types of characters are able to lead a larger party of more 
          creatures, gaining special abilities that give them an extra pool of 
          party CR for a specific kind of ally. This pool is added to the main
          allotment in the same manner that the CR of two creatures is added
          together.
          __The Leadership feat increases the PCR of your base party pool by +3.\n\n 
          
          <3>The Magic Pool<1>\n
          __All characters have a magic pool that can absorb the CR of summoned
          creatures, animated undead, conjured force constructs and so forth. This 
          pool is equal to the average of your character level and your caster 
          level -- in other words, a straight spellcaster will have a pool equal to 
          their character level and a character with no casting ability will have a 
          pool equal to half their character level. All magically created or 
          transported creatures, from spells, innate abilities or magical items, 
          draw from this pool; if their PCR exceeds it, the excess bleeds over into 
          the general Party CR normally.\n
          __Some summoning effects summon creatures which are 'freebies' and do not
          count towards this pool.\n\n
          
          <3>The Commanded Undead Pool<1>\n
          __Characters with the Rebuke/Command Undead gain a pool specifically
          for commanded undead equal to their level in the Rebuke/Command Undead
          ability -- in other words, their priest level. Any excess commanded undead
          bleed over into the Party CR pool normally. Rebuked undead are not allies,
          merely afraid, and thus do not count toward any pool.\n\n
          
          <3>The Undead Horde Pool<1>\n
          __In addition to the magic pool, specialist necromancers receive a second
          pool that applies only to animated undead. This pool has a CR equal to 
          the character's Mage level. Animated undead subtract PCR first from this
          pool, then from the magic pool, and finally from the general party pool.
          As a result, a necromancer can control a quite substantial number of
          undead creatures...\n\n
          
          <3>The Animal Companion Pool<1>\n
          __Characters with the Animal Companion ability receive a pool that can
          only be used for animal companions; this pool is equal in CR to the
          character's rating in the Animal Companion ability -- usually the sum
          of the character's ranger and druid levels.\n
          __This pool applies to any non-magical animal allies of the character, 
          whether they are the actual single animal companion granted by the
          Animal Companion ability, or other animals befriended and recruited
          using the Animal Empathy skill.\n\n
          
          <3>The Diplomacy Bonus<1>\n
          __The Diplomacy skill does not grant a seperate pool like the above
          abilities; instead, for every +5 by which your Diplomacy rating
          exceeds +5, you receive a +2 bonus to the CR of your base party
          pool. Thus, Diplomacy +10 increases your base PCR by +2, Diplomacy
          +15 increases it by +4, and so forth.\n\n

          <3>That Special Heroic Quality<1>\n
          __Incursion does not currently include a monster experience system
          -- allies do not advance. Thus, to make companions gained with the
          Diplomacy skill viable medium-term allies, they receive the same
          'heroic quality' that player characters have, giving them 20 base
          hit points in addition to those gained from Hit Dice and Constitution
          bonus. This benefit only applies to races that can receive class
          templates, not to monsterous creatures, and does not apply to
          animal companions, summoned creatures, illusions, animated dead,
          and so forth. This helps to balance the fact that other types of
          companions are normally easier to replace than mundane NPC allies
          if they should die.\n\n

         <9>SHOPS AND BARTER {SB}\n
            ================\n<1>         
         __Incursion characters can visit shops in order to purchase items,
         or barter with other creatures in order to buy and sell gear. The
         prices in shops will be very bloated for the majority of characters
         -- selling magical gear to adventurers is a very risky business and
         shopkeepers demand rather extreme premiums from their customers.
         As a result, most characters will be able to use the shops only to
         buy potions, skill kits and other low-cost items; powerful magic
         will remain outside their financial range.\n
         __The price of items in shops is determined by a character's Diplomacy
         skill rating, so characters with ratings of +10 or higher in Diplomacy
         will be better able to make use of shops than normal characters,
         potentially being able to buy powerful magical items from them. As
         always, in Incursion characters excel at the things they were
         designed to do, and are poor at most other things; this effect is very 
         much intentional.\n
         __Characters with Diplomacy as a class skill or a Charisma of 13+ can 
         also barter with other non-hostile sapient creatures in the dungeon, 
         buying or selling goods. This works in exactly the same manner as with 
         shops, except that most wandering NPCs will have only very limited funds 
         to buy items from the PC, and in turn can sell only the items they have 
         as gear. However, their prices will be much more reasonable since they 
         are not trying to make a living merely selling goods in an exceedingly 
         hazardous enviornment, but are instead fellow adventurers present for 
         much the same reasons your own character is.\n\n
         
         <9>Service Spells<1>\n
         __NPC spellcasters such as priests, dragons or nagas can also sell 
         services in the form of spells they are capable of casting. Most
         spells are difficult to pass on in this way, but some, especially
         curatives and abjurations like <9>neutralize poison<1>, <9>remove
         curse<1>, <9>identify<1> and <9>cure disease<1> can make very
         useful commodities.\n
         __When an NPC is able to cast such a spell, that spell will appear
         along with their gear in the bartering window, and can be purchased
         accordingly. When you purchase a service spell, it will be cast 
         immediately, and you will receive an effect prompt to target it
         when the barter screen closes -- so make sure that whatever or
         whoever you want it cast on is in range!\n\n
          
         <9>The Bartering Interface<1>\n
         __Bartering is initiated either by entering a store or by using the
         Talk ('t') command on a neutral NPC willing to barter with you;
         either of these actions bring up the store interface, listing all
         the available goods along with their prices.\n
         __You can scroll through the listed goods using the [UP] and [DOWN]
         cursor keys, and the Examine ('x') command will allow you to
         scrutinize an item in more depth. The list of items can be
         scrolled up and down without changing the selected item using
         the [PGUP] and [PGDN] keys. All items in the barter window
         are listed fully identified, if you buy an item, all items of the
         exact same type will be identified as well, just as if you had
         identified such an item on your own.\n
         __Hitting [ESC] cancels the barter window, returning to normal
         gameplay. Typing the number listed beside an item will purchase
         that item; pressing [ENTER] will purchase the currently highlighted
         item. Purchases always ask for confirmation, and if the store or NPC
         has more than one of the item in question, you will also be asked
         whether you want to purchase one, some or all. Rope is sold in
         increments of five feet; uneven numbers of feet will be rounded
         up!\n\n
         
         <9>Selling Items<1>\n
         __Items can be sold with the Sell ('s') command, which allows you
         to select any item from your inventory and offer it to whoever you
         are bartering with. Most people won't be interested in most items,
         however. Roark Ironbeard will always buy the valuable gems gained
         from mining, however, and will also purchase powerful magical arms
         and armour from persuasive characters -- those with a Diplomacy
         rating modified by any social modifiers of +12 or higher.\n
         __Shopkeepers will only purchase a finite number of items from any
         given character over the course of an entire game. This prevents
         'grinding', encouraging players to sell only a rare few valuable
         items rather than spending endless time carting large amounts of
         loot up to sell to shopkeepers to scum for gold. The number of items
         a shopkeeper will buy is always a character's Diplomacy score,
         adjusted by any social modifiers, divided by a set constant -- four,
         in the case of Roark Ironbeard.";

      <3>__Combat in Incursion is resolved in much the same way as it
      is in its parent OGL system, but with the distinct differences
      caused by the percentile speed and movement rates, and the lack
      of initiative or round-based ordering of actions.

      \n<11>
      \nCOMBAT BASICS {CB}\n
      =============<3>\n
      __Whenever one character attacks another in Incursion, the game
      makes an attack roll to determine if the attack is a hit, miss
      or critical hit. The attack roll is the sum total of the attacker's
      base attack bonus in the relevant category (archery, brawl, melee
      or throwing), any modifiers due to weapon, magic, feats, ability
      scores or circumstances, and the result of a single twenty-sided 
      dice. If this value is equal to or higher than the opponent's Defense
      Class, the attack is a hit. If it is lower, the attack is a miss.\n
      __<11>Timing:<3> A single attack at 100% speed takes 30 segments to
      complete. This value is modified by the percentile speed exactly
      as one might expect -- a character with 200% speed requires 15 segments
      to perform an attack, while one with 50% speed requires 60 segments.
      In comparison, it takes 10 segments for a character with 100%
      movement rate to move ten feet (one square), seven segments for a
      character with Dexterity 10 to pick up an object, and ten segments
      for a character to cast a spell or use most special abilities.\n
      __Actions occur on a timeline scheme. If you perform an action
      that takes six segments, your next action will occur six segments further
      down on the timeline. One consequence of this is that if you have a
      faster speed than another character, they will never be able to
      attack you more than once in combat without you having an action
      in the interim.\n
      __<11>Natural Attacks:<3> Monstrous creatures have natural attacks --
      claw rakes, fanged bites, tentacles that lash and ensnare, and so
      forth. Often, they will have more than one form of attack. Creatures
      can make all of their natural attacks in a single sequence at the
      same time -- for example, many creatures have a bite/claw/claw pattern.
      The first attack is at no penalty, but all the latter attacks suffer a
      -5 penalty to hit, or -2 if the creature has the Multiattack feat. All
      of these individual attacks occur at the same time, and the whole
      sequence costs segments only as per a single attack.

      \n<11>
      \nRANGED COMBAT {RC}\n
      =============<3>\n
      __Ranged combat is handled in largely the same way as melee combat, with
      a few notable exceptions. Running into a monster with arrow keys obviously
      always represents a melee attack. To make a ranged attack, you can either
      use the 'f' command, or the [SHIFT]+Arrow Key keyboard shortcuts.\n

      __<11>Cover:<3> When making a ranged attack -- with a bow or crossbow, 
      a thrown weapon or a ray spell -- it becomes more difficult to hit
      targets who are behind cover. The game considers this to be the case
      whenever there is a solid stone block directly beside the intended
      target in the horizontal or vertical direction that points closest to 
      the attacker. For example, the hill giant below receives cover against
      the adventurer's archery:
      \n____<7>########################
      \n____#_______________<15>@<7>_______
      \n____#<6>H<14>#<7>#####################
      \n____#_######################<3>
      \n__A target that has cover is assigned a miss chance of 50~. This means
      that the attack has a 50~ chance of simply having been determined to
      have missed without the attack roll even having been made. The game will
      notify you of a miss that is due to a percentile miss chance by telling
      you that you missed 'wildly'.
      \n__There are some magical effects that also grant a percentile miss chance,
      such as the <9>blink<3> spell or a Cloak of Displacement. If more than one
      miss chance applies, each is rolled separately.\n

      <3>__*_Placing items in or taking items out of other 
      containers has a timecost in segments that varies with the
      container. Special purpose containers, such as the ivory
      scroll case that mages begin play with, are often much
      faster in this regard than the leather backpack.\n

      \n<11>
      \nEXPLORING AND FIGHTING {EF}\n
      ======================<3>\n
      __Your character's first status line on the status panel always reads
      either 'Exploring' or 'Fighting'. This describes the character's state
      of combat readiness in relation to the situation around him. As soon
      as a character is either attacked, or attacks another character (with
      a spell or weapon), the status will change from Exploring to Fighting,
      and will remain that way for several rounds thereafter -- the exact
      number of rounds a character remains alert is based on his Wisdom score.\n
      __A character who is attacked while Exploring is said to have been
      caught <11>flat-footed<3>. Such a character loses their Dexterity
      bonus to their defense class, as the attack caught them partially
      unexpectedly and they did not have time to fully ready themselves
      for combat. Essentially, a minor advantage goes to whichever characters
      strike the first blow in a given combat, and against those who are
      struck before they can strike.\n
      __This may seem like a trivial penalty, and usually it is. It can be
      much more deadly when fighting rogues or other characters with the
      Sneak Attack ability, however, as they gain significant amounts of
      bonus damage when attacking flat-footed characters.\n\n
      
      \n<11>SURPRISE ATTACKS {SA}\n
        ================<3>\n
      __When a character attacks another character, and the victim is 
      cannot perceive the attacker -- as a result of invisibility, hiding
      in shadows, the victim being blind or any other cause -- an opposed 
      Move Silently versus Listen check is made. If the victim succeeds, 
      she hears the attacker and negates surprise. If the attacker 
      succeeds, however, she has scored a surprise attack. Any attack
      made against a sleeping creature is also considered a surprise
      attack.\n
      __Surprise attacks receive a +4 surprise bonus to hit, and the
      attacker can substitute her Dexterity for Strength when determining
      damage, if doing so benefits her. The victim is also denied her
      Dexterity bonus to defense, as with being flat-footed above --
      thus allowing a rogue to gain Sneak Attack damage. Obviously,
      setting up surprise attacks is very valuable especially to rogues,
      but also to any high-Dexterity character.\n 

      \n<11>
      \nARMOUR AND RESISTANCES {AR}\n
      =====================<3>\n
      __In Incursion, armour reduces damage rather than just adding a set value
      to defense that must be beaten on the attack roll. Every type of armour
      has three ratings -- resistance to slashing, piercing and blunt damage.
      Similarly, all weapons inflict one of these types of damage, determining
      which armour value is used against them. Some weapons inflict two types
      of damage -- slashing and piercing, for example. In this case, whichever
      damage type is more beneficial to the attacker is used.\n
      __The amount of damage a given armour type removes is calculated based on
      an internal table by the game. In practice, you can quickly get a feel
      for how much damage armour of a given type will protect you from. Note 
      that armours of lower ratings are less effective against greater amounts
      of damage -- an armour level that takes 50% of the damage off of a 27-point
      hit might only take 30% off of a 46-point hit.\n
      __Resistances are gained from magical items. They work exactly the same
      as armour ratings, but instead of applying against slashing, piercing or
      blunt damage, resistances lower damage from the elemental types: fire,
      cold, acid, lightning, toxic damage or sonic damage. Resistances are 
      typically a little higher than armour values, simply because elemental
      damage is usually doled out in larger amounts at once, coming from sources
      such as a wizard's spell or a dragon's breath weapon, and thus needs a
      higher value to protect against it effectively.\n
      __<11>Stacking Armour:<3> Armour and resistances can be gained from multiple
      sources in Incursion -- for example, a lizardman in a chainmail hauberk 
      has both his natural armour rating and the armour values of the chainmail.
      Similarly, a mage might have fire resistance both from an amulet he wears
      and from a spell he just cast. In these cases, the final applicable value
      is determined by taking the largest armour or resistance value and adding 
      to it half of the second largest value, a third of the third largest, a
      fourth of the fourth largest, and so forth.\n
      __Note that like all things in Incursion, values from similar sources 
      overlap, rather than stacking. Specifically, resistances may benefit at
      most from A) one permanent item granting that resistance, and B) one
      spell, potion or scroll granting that resistance. Thus, the fire resistance
      of a Ring of Fire Resistance does not stack with a second ring, but it
      would stack with a Resist Fire spell.\n
      __<11>Coverage:<3> Coverage is an addition to defense class that describes
      the amount of the body covered by armour. Every suit of armour has a coverage
      rating, and coverage can be increased by wearing protective items such as
      armoured helmets and boots. If an attack roll exceeds the sum of the armour
      wearer's defense class and coverage, that attack has bypassed the armour
      completely, and the armour ratings from physical armour are ignored when 
      calculating damage. Natural armour and other sources of resistance to physical
      damage still apply normally, however.\n
      __<11>Penetration:<3> While energy is energy, weapons are driven by their
      wielder's strength, and a powerful blow can cleave through armour's protection.
      In game terms, a positive secondary Strength modifier reduces armour's effective
      protection by its magnitude, to a maximum reduction of half. For example, if a
      character with 20 Strength (secondary modifier +4) strikes a character with 5
      points of armour rating against the relevant type of damage, that character has
      an effective armour of 3 after Penetration is factored in.\n
      __Certain weapons are able to penetrate armour (natural or otherwise) more
      effectively than most. These weapons grant a +2 bonus to Penetration, and this
      bonus is applied after the half-only cap is applied, meaning that such a weapon
      can negate more than half of an enemy's armour rating.\n\n
      
      <11>Armour vs. Special Attacks<3>\n
      __If a physical attack (a claw or sting, for example) carries with it
      a special form of damage or deleterious effect (such as poison, experience
      or attribute draining or so forth -- but not elemental damage), the
      victim will only suffer that damage if the attacker's attack roll is
      higher than the victim's Defense Class + (Coverage - 4). If the attack
      roll is higher than DC but not DC + (Coverage - 4), then the attack
      will inflict only hit point damage.\n
      __If a character has armour with the <11>sacred<3> quality, that armour
      will block touch attacks with special effects the same way it blocks
      claws and other physical attacks.

      \n<11>
      \nFATIGUE POINTS {FP}\n
      ==============<3>\n
      __Adventurers consistently attempt difficult and tiring actions, not the
      least of which is brutal combat. Some activities strain the body and spirit
      even more than these trials, however. The berserk fury of a barbarian, a
      priest's ability to channel sacred energies from the positive material
      plane through his own body to drive off the undead, or even the titanic
      strike of a warrior praying to down a terrible foe with a single mighty
      blow -- all these things place strain on an adventurer far beyond what
      they normally experience.\n
      __This strain is represented by fatigue points. A number of different actions
      cost fatigue, as shown on the table below. If a character drops below 0
      fatigue points, they are considered to be fatigued, and will suffer a
      reduction in effective Strength and Constitution. If they continue to
      expend fatigue until they reach negative fatigue points equal to their
      normal positive maximum, they are considered to be exhausted. Spending
      any further fatigue points when exhausted entails a risk of passing out
      for several turns, leaving the character effectively helpless. If this
      risk is accepted, a Fortitude save is made to determine whether the
      character can remain conscious whenever more fatigue points are spent.\n
      __<11>Recovering Fatigue<3>: Normal magical healing does nothing to
      restore lost fatigue; the primary way to recover it is simply to rest.
      A character who is not fatigued when they rest regains all of their
      fatigue points immediately. A character who is fatigued recovers all
      of their fatigue points only if the night passes uneventfully; in the
      case of an encounter, only a portion of the fatigue points lost will
      be recovered. An exhausted character recovers only one fatigue point
      when resting, requiring several nights to fully recover from the
      effects.\n
      __<11>Fatigue Costs:<3> The following actions all cause a character to
      expend fatigue. Actions marked with an asterisk are not currently
      implemented in this version of Incursion, but will appear in a future
      release.\n

      \nTHE STRENGTH BONUS {SB}\n
      ==================<3>\n
      __All attacks gain an attribute bonus to hit -- by default, melee and 
      brawling attacks are modified by Strength, whereas archery and thrown
      weapons are modified by Dexterity. (The Combat Finesse feat allows
      characters to substitute Dexterity for Strength on most brawl and melee
      attack rolls).\n
      __However, normally only Strength grants a bonus to damage, and this bonus is
      granted on nearly all types of attacks. There are several factors which 
      influence exactly what bonus is granted based on Strength, however:\n      
      __<15>*<3>_If a character wields a weapon in both hands, they are able to
      place greater force behind their attacks, and receive 1.5 times their
      normal strength bonus to attack.\n
      __<15>*<3>_If a character is fighting with two weapons, the weapon in their
      off hand receives only half of the character's normal Strength bonus
      to damage.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When making a natural attack sequence, creatures receive their
      full Strength bonus to damage on the first attack and only half their
      Strength bonus to damage on the remainder of their attacks.\n
      __<15>*<3>_Characters using a bow receive their Strength bonus to damage
      only if their bow has the Mighty quality. Characters using a crossbow
      never receive a Strength bonus to damage.\n
      __<15>*<3>_A normal punch by a humanoid character receives full Strength
      bonus; a kick receives 1.5 times the normal Strength bonus, but also has
      the attack time in segments increased from 30 to 50.\n

      \n<11>
      \nCRITICAL HITS {CR}\n
      =============<3>\n
      __Every attack in Incursion has the potential to be a critical hit. When
      the attack roll scores very high before any modifiers are applied to the
      roll, and hits the creature's defense class, a second identical attack roll 
      is immediately made to see if the attack is a critical hit. If the second
      attack roll also hits the creature's defense class, the attack is considered
      to be a critical hit.\n
      __<11>Threat Range:<3> The threat range of a weapon or attack determines
      what must be rolled on the first attack roll before any modifiers are
      applied for that roll to be a potential critical hit, or a <11>threat<3>.
      For example, the long sword has a threat range of 19-20, meaning that it
      scores a threat whenever the 1d20 rolled for the attack roll comes up as
      a 19 or 20. In other words, 10% of all attacks rolled with a long sword
      will be threats. Unless otherwise noted, all attacks have a threat range
      of 20 -- normally only weapon attacks benefit from an increased threat 
      range.\n
      __Several factors can increase the threat range of an attack. The <11>keen<3>
      weapon quality and the <15>Improved Crit<3> feat are the most common. Both
      of these abilities double the threat range of an attack. Multiple doublings
      triple or quadruple rather than growing exponentially, however; thus, the
      threat range of a keen long sword in the hands of a character with Improved
      Crit is 15-20, or three times the base threat range of a long sword.\n
      __<11>Crit Multiplier:<3> All attacks also have a crit multiplier; if not
      noted elsewhere, the default crit multiplier for an attack is x2. This is
      the figure by which the damage the attack inflicts is multiplied by on a
      critical hit. Since the battleaxe has a x3 crit multiplier, it inflicts
      three times its normal damage when a critical hit is scored.\n
      __The damage multiplier affects all the damage a weapon inflicts, including
      damage bonuses due to skill, magic and Strength. The only exception to this
      is that bonus dice of damage -- such as those from a flaming sword or a
      rogue's sneak attack ability -- are not multiplied by a critical hit, though
      they are added in once normally.\n
      __<11>Crit Immunity:<3> Critical hits most often depend upon striking a
      vital area or landing a particularly solid blow. Creatures with no
      discernable anatomy -- golems, oozes and jellies, elementals and similar
      beings -- are immune to critical hits for this reason, though they still
      suffer normal damage from an attack that would have been a crit. Undead
      are immune to critical hits only from piercing weapons, as they have no
      functioning internal organs to puncture.\n

      \n<11>
      \nATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY {AO}\n
      ======================<3>\n
      __In certain circumstances, creatures are allowed to make bonus attacks on
      other creatures, usually due to those creatures taking some action that
      leaves a hole in their defenses. Holding a sword, an adventurer can keep
      the pointy end leveled at his adversaries and hold them at bay on risk
      of impalement. However, if the adventurer instead decides to ready his
      longbow and shoot an arrow while a monster is standing right next to him,
      that choice leaves him open to attack, and the monster is allowed to make
      a free bonus attack against him. This attack is called an attack of opportunity,
      and such attacks can be distinguished from normal attacks because the attack
      message that results is usually (but not always) prefixed with 'Seeing an
      opportunity, '. Both the player character and the monsters are allowed to
      make attacks of opportunity. The following situations provoke these attacks:\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a character casts a spell, he provokes an attack of opportunity
      from any creature that has him in their threatened area. The Defensive Spell
      feat can be used to negate this.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a character makes a ranged attack, either by firing a bow,
      sling or crossbow, or throwing something, attacks of opportunity are similarly
      provoked.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a character is within another creature's threatened area and
      attempts to leave that area by fleeing, they provoke an attack of opportunity
      from each creature whose threatened area they are leaving.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a creature is held or paralyzed, they provoke one attack of
      opportunity from every creature whose threat range they are in every round.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a creature without the Martial Mastery feat (or the monk's 
      Unarmed Strike class feature, which supercedes the feat) punches or kicks
      an enemy, they provoke an attack of opportunity from that specific enemy.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a creature uses certain tactical options (such as Bull Rush
      or Disarm) and does not have the feat that improves their skill with those,
      they provoke an attack of opportunity.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a creature invokes an innate spell-like ability, they provoke
      an attack of opportunity from all creatures threatening them, unless they have
      the Guarded Invocation feat.\n
      __<15>*<3>_When a creature attacks an enemy who is wielding a weapon two or more
      size categories larger than her own, the enemy receives an attack of opportunity
      -- it is hard to fight a sword-wielder with a dagger! This does not apply if the
      attacker uses a martial arts weapon, or the defender is surprised, caught flat-
      footed or unable to perceive the attacker.
      __Note that Incursion is slightly nicer about attacks of opportunity than its
      parent system: using magic items generally does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity, nor does moving around within another creature's threatened area,
      so long as you aren't leaving it.\n
      __<11>Making the Attack:<3> Attacks of opportunity are in most ways exactly
      like any other attack. They are always a true single attack - creatures with
      a natural attack sequence make only their first attack as an attack of
      opportunity, not the whole sequence. Similarly, when wielding two weapons,
      creatures do not get an offhand attack on an attack of opportunity, and feats
      like Cleave do not affect opportunity attacks. In Incursion, opportunity 
      attacks are always normal attacks -- you can't perform a disarm or other 
      tactical option as an attack of opportunity.\n
      __There is a set limit to the number of attacks of opportunity that a character
      can make in one round (60 segments). For most characters, this limit is a single
      attack; for characters with the Combat Reflexes feat, the limit is 1 + the
      character's Dexterity modifier.\n
      __<11>Threatened Area:<3> When a creature does something that provokes attacks
      of opportunity, usually only creatures that have the character in their
      threatened areas can make an attack of opportunity on him. A character's
      threatened area describes the area where other creatures must be standing
      in order for him to be able to make melee attacks on them. For most character,
      this is the eight squares immediately surrounding the character's current
      location. For characters with reach, the threatened area may be larger,
      as described below.

      \n<11>
      \nREACH {RE}\n
      =====<3>\n
      __Some weapons are longer than others. Reach weapons are long enough to allow
      characters to attack opponents who are one square distant from them, rather
      than those that are right beside them. Usually, this means that the wielder
      of a reach weapon can only attack creatures at this range -- once they have
      slipped closer, his current weapon is useless and he must first wield something
      else or move back if he wishes to make an attack. Some rare weapons, such as
      the spiked chain, allow a wielder to attack creatures both close up and up
      to one square away.\n
      __<11>Closing:<3> Reach weapons can be used to prevent a creature from closing 
      to normal melee range. When a creature attempts to move up beside an enemy who 
      wields a reach weapon, they must make a Reflex saving throw against a DC equal 
      to 10 + half the wielder's BAB (melee or brawl, as suitable), plus her Dexterity 
      modifier, plus the parry modifier of the weapon used, if any. If the save is 
      successful, the movement is completed normally. If the save fails, however, the 
      movement is halted, the creature attempting to move is delayed for 30 segments 
      and provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature he was attempting to 
      close with.\n
      __<11>Natural Reach:<3> Some creatures -- usually giants -- are born with natural
      reach as a result of the length of their arms. They can attack as if with a
      reach weapon regardless of what (if anything) they are wielding. Creatures with
      natural reach can always attack creatures right next to them as well, in a
      manner similar to spiked chain wielders.\n


      \n<11>
      \nLEAVING A THREATENED AREA {LE}\n
      =========================<3>\n     
     __Creatures (including the player) threaten the space around 
     them, meaning that attempting to leave their vicinity can be 
     dangerous. (Creatures with reach weapons, special abilities
     or different feats may threaten a larger area.) When you make 
     a movement that would take you out of one or more creature's 
     threatened areas, the game offers you three options:\n
     __* <14>Disengage<7> -- You try to withdraw from melee tactically 
     without exposing yourself to danger. If you win an opposed
     contest with each threatening creature of your Base Attack 
     Bonus + 1d20 (Brawl or Melee bonus, whichever is higher),
     you are able to complete the movement action without provoking
     an attack of opportunity. If you fail, you both provoke an
     attack of opportunity from each creature you failed against,
     and you don't move at all.\n
     __* <14>Flee<7> -- You automatically escape melee and complete
     the selected movement action, but provoke an attack of opportunity
     from every creature whose threatened area you leave.\n
     __* <14>Abort<7> -- You elect to re-think things, and do not
     move at all. Use this option if you didn't realize you were
     threatened, and want to do something other than retreat.\n
     __Note that disengage, if successful, gives you a slight head
     start as you distract the enemy, but flee does not. Thus, flee
     is useless if the enemy is has a faster Mov than you -- you give
     them an attack of opportunity, and they'll just close with you
     again immediately after your move.

      \n<11>
      \nTACTICAL OPTIONS {TO}\n
      ================<3>\n
      __Incursion offers the player a number of different possible options in combat.
      Simple melee or unarmed attacks can be performed by running into a monster,
      while ranged weapons can be fired by pressing SHIFT and an arrow key. However,
      there is also a menu of more involved combat maneuvers that can be accessed by
      pressing 'c'. These choices are as follows:\n
      __<11>Attack:<3> Use this option to perform a normal attack against a creature 
      who is not yet hostile to you (Walking into these characters will normally just 
      displace them) or is invisible or otherwise imperceptible.\n
      __<11>Break Grapple:<3> You attempt to break out of an enemy's grab or grapple 
      with a grapple check. If successful, this maneuver takes no time to complete, 
      giving you an opportunity to get out of melee range, but if failed it takes up 
      a full round.\n
      __<11>Bull Rush:<3> You attempt to force an opponent back one square by charging 
      into them. This is resolved with an opposed Strength roll modified by +4/-4 for 
      every difference in size category between you and your opponent. A bull rush 
      normally provokes an attack of opportunity from the target.\n
      __<11>Called Shot:<3> You aim an attack at a specific part of an opponent's body, 
      hoping to inflict a debilitating injury rather than just going for the kill. 
      <13>Not implemented yet.<2>\n
      __<11>Charge:<3> You run in a straight line, accumulating plusses to hit and 
      damage due to momentum as you move. See below for more information.\n 
      __<11>Charge, Automatic:<3> As <11>Charge<3> above, but whenever you
      change directions you automatically start charging in the new direction if
      an enemy is visible that way (the <11>Ride-by-Attack<3> feat helps here). You 
      will not be asked confirmation questions about breaking off charges and
      starting new ones. This option is handy, but dangerous, for mounted combatants.\n
      __<11>Coup de Grace:<3> You deliver a killing blow to a paralyzed or sleeping 
      living humanoid opponent within 10 feet of you. The attack is an automatic critical, 
      and even if the foe survives the damage they must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 
      half of the damage dealt) or die anyway. Performing a Coup de Grace  provokes 
      attacks of opportunity from every non-paralyzed or sleeping enemy within 1 square.\n
      __<11>Disarm:<3> You cause an opponent to lose their  weapon. An opposed attack 
      roll is made, modified by both Strength and Dexterity, as well as +/- 4 for weapon 
      size differences, and using the weapon's parry modifier instead of its accuracy. 
      Success causes the opponent to lose their weapon; failure means they are allowed 
      to make an immediate Disarm attempt against you, without it costing them an action. 
      A Disarm attempt normally provokes an attack of opportunity.\n
      __<11>Fight Defensively:<3> By devoting your full attention to defense, you can 
      gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your defense class  at the expense of suffering a -4 
      circumstance penalty to attack rolls,  -2 to damage, 75~ normal movement rate and a 
      -20% spell success chance.  Once fighting defensively, you can stop by using the 
      'x' command.\n
      __<11>Grapple:<3> You grab your opponent and initiate a grapple with him. Grappling 
      is resolved with grapple checks, which are opposed contests of Brawl attack bonus 
      plus Strength modifier plus or minus 4 for every divergence in size category, 
      favouring the larger character. To begin grappling, however, you must hit your
      target's DC as per a normal attack. Initiating a grapple provokes an attack of 
      opportunity from your target.\n
      __<11>Great Blow:<3> You execute a titanically powerful blow with your weapon, 
      allowing you to double your Strength modifier to attack and damage, and lowering 
      the threat range of your attack by 3 (i.e., 19-20 becomes 16-20). However, a 
      great blow takes 1 1/2 times as long as a normal attack, costs two Fatigue points 
      and leaves you off-balance and Exposed for a full round after you finish it.\n
      __<11>Sprint:<3> You put on a desperate burst of speed, and increase you movement 
      rate by 50% for [1 + Constitution modifier] rounds (minimum 1) at the cost of two 
      fatigue points. Since you are running full out, Sprint also decreases your defense 
      class by two.\n
      __<11>Sunder Weapon:<3> You strike an opponent's weapon (or, at your option, any 
      unattended object) and attempt to damage or destroy it. This provokes an attack 
      of opportunity from the person using the weapon. Weapons with a magical plus can
      not be destroyed by any weapon with a lower magical plus than their own.\n
      __<11>Throw:<3> You throw an enemy you are grappling with already one or more 
      squares away from you. You must succeed in a grapple check against them, and this 
      action ends the grapple. You inflict your normal unarmed damage value in subdual 
      damage, plus one point per square the enemy is thrown.\n
      __<11>Trip:<3> You attempt to knock an opponent prone. You must first make a 
      successful attack roll against his DC, and then you make a Strength check opposed 
      by his Strength or Dexterity,  whichever favours him more. Success knocks the target 
      prone. Failure allows the target to make an immediate, free attempt to trip you in
      return. Some weapons grant a bonus to trip attempts, such as the quarterstaff.\n
      __Note that if you have them, the Spring Attack and Whirlwind Attack feats
      also appear on this menu.

      \n<11>
      \nTWO-WEAPON COMBAT {2W}\n
      =================<3>\n
      __Characters in Incursion can fight with two weapons at once. To do this, wield
      one weapon in your ready hand slot and the other in your weapon slot; you'll then
      automatically fight in two-weapon style. This means that you get to make one
      attack with each weapon, using up total segments equal to a single attack with
      whichever weapon in slower plus half the segments of a single attack with the
      faster weapon. However, you also suffer penalties to the attack rolls with each 
      hand, starting at -4 / -6. These penalties are reduced, however,
      by taking the Two-Weapon Style and Ambidexterity feats, and if the weapon in your
      offhand is one or more size categories smaller than the weapon in your primary
      hand.\n

      \n<11>
      \nMOUNTED COMBAT {MC}\n
      ==============<3>\n
      __Incursion allows characters to ride horses and stranger creatures, gaining
      a combat advantage by so doing. A creature must be allied to be a suitable
      mount; to mount a creature, select the Mount verb from the Yuse ('y') command
      menu. Characters built around mounted combat might find it beneficial to bind
      a Quick Key to this verb. The Dismount command is also found on the Yuse menu,
      or you can dismount using the Cancel ('x') command\n
      __Some weapons (e.g., the heavy lance and great lance) cannot be used unless
      mounted (or unless you are really huge). Paladins start with mounts and 
      eventually gain sacred mounts. Mages can summon them with, for example, the 1st
      level spell 'Mount'. Druids can eventually summon animal companions that will 
      serve as mounts. A very handy (and very dangerous) command for mounted players 
      is the 'Charge, Automatic' command in the Combat Options menu. The Mounted Combat 
      feat tree allows characters to make the best use of their mount in combat.\n
      __Casting a spell with somatic gestures while mounted requires 15 phases extra,
      since the character must control her mount. This does not apply if the spell
      is Stilled, or the character has a Balance skill of 20+.\n\n 

      <11>Mounts and Terrain<3>\n
      __Difficult terrain will pay attention to whether you are mounted or not. If
      you are mounted, your mount makes the balance check on grease or ice. Your
      mount takes the fire damage from brimstone. If your mount has the Woodland
      Stride ability, it carries you through safely even if you don't. Note that
      some magical items (e.g., girdles of the inferno) specifically say that
      they protect both you and your mount. If your mount is a paladin's sacred
      mount or a ranger or druid's animal companion, spells you cast on yourself
      (e.g., resist fire, resist water) will also affect it, which may make some
      terrain easier.\n
      __If you would be knocked prone while you are mounted, you can made a Ride
      skill check (DC 20) to keep steady on your mount. Otherwise you fall off. 
      If your mount would be knocked prone while you are mounted, you can make a
      Ride check (DC 40) to keep your mount from falling. Otherwise you also fall
      off.\n
      __Deep (or turbulent) water is the only truly complicated case. Both of you
      have to survive the water somehow. If you are OK with water but your mount
      is not (e.g., lizardfolk riding a horse), your mount will still need swim
      checks and may drown out from under you. If your mount does not need to
      breathe air but you do (e.g., human riding a giant shark), you can still
      drown. If you both don't care about the water, however, everything is fine
      (e.g., graveborn necromancer riding a zombie warhorse).  Finally, if your
      mount carries you completely above the water (e.g., because it is flying or
      has water-walking) then you don't even need to make the swim checks and
      will not drown.\n\n

      <11>CHARGING {CH}\n
          ========<3>
      __Characters can charge in combat using the Combat Options panel,
      allowing them to inflict greater damage as a result of gained
      momentum. Some weapons double or triple the damage bonus that 
      charging grants, and being mounted also increases the effect. You can
      only charge if you have a visible opponent in the direction you wish
      to charge in -- you can't charge at hypothetical enemies.\n
      __As you charge, you accumulate a Charge Bonus shown at the bottom of
      the screen in the Status Window. This bonus increases the more squares
      you charge. When you make an attack at the end of a charge, you will
      receive a flat +2 bonus to hit; if you do hit, this charge bonus will
      be added to your damage.\n
      __While charging, you can only move in the direction you started the
      charge in and the two directions immediately next to that direction
      -- for example, if you charge north, you can only move north, northeast
      or northwest; any other direction will cause you to break off the
      charge and lose any existing charge bonus.\n
      __While you are charging you move at 150~ of your normal rate, but suffer
      a -2 penalty to Defense. You can Charge and Sprint at the same time, but
      thde higher Sprint movement bonus replaces the Charge movement bonus rather 
      than stacking with it. You are considered to be exposed while charging, and 
      for one turn thereafter.\n
      __As you charge, you accumulate a damage bonus determined by your movement 
      rate and the combined mass of you and your mount. The bonus per set is
      calculated internally from a table inside the game, and ca become quite
      substantial with a long charge on a heavy, fast mount.\n
      __While you are charging you do not get to make attacks of opportunity. You
      are denied your dexterity bonus to your defense class. You are subject to
      sneak attacks as if you were flat footed or flanked. After your first step,
      every step you take while charging provokes an attack of opportunity
      (movement) from all nearby foes. If you attempt mounted archery, your
      penalty is doubled while charging.\n 
      __If you have the Power Charge feat, your threat range is increased by
      one third of your charge bonus. If you hit with a lance, spear or polearm
      while charging you do double damage. If you have the Spirited Charge feat
      and you are mounted, you do triple damage instead (or double damage with a
      non-lance). On one in four successful hits, your weapon takes blunt damage 
      equal to your charge bonus.\n
      __Notably, this means that if you charge with a non-magical (or even weakly
      magical) lance it will eventually break. Read up on actual jousting if this
      seems unrealistic to you. Realism aside, the game balance reason is that
      charging is quite powerful, especially at low levels, and should not be
      undertaken lightly or used constantly. That said, the 'Charge, Automatic'
      option in the Combat Options menu makes it much easier.\n 
      __Closing with an opponent that has a reach weapon normally requires a Reflex
      save. If you are charging, you generally close automatically. However, if
      when you close with something while charging that thing gets a free attack
      of opportunity (movement) against you. If you take any damage in that
      attack you must DC 30 Reflex save to avoid tripping. If any part of this
      stops you from charging, you fail to close.\n
      __An opponent making a movement-based attack of opportunity against you while
      you are charging also adds your charge bonus to damage against you (and
      deals double damage with an appropriate weapon) -- momentum is symmetric.
      The Guarded Stance feat provides bonuses in this area. Charging into a set
      of braced polearms is not a good idea.\n\n
      
      <11>WEAPON TABLE {WT}\n
          ============<3>\n
      __The following table summarizes the traits of the various weapons found in
      Incursion. Type specifies the type of damage inflicted; [S]lashing, [P]iercing
      or [B]lunt; weapons that can inflict multiple types of damage are always
      treated as inflicting the most favourable type. SDmg is the base damage against
      creatures of Medium size or smaller; LDmg is the damage against Large or larger
      creatures. Acc is a modifier to the attack roll, while Parry is a modifier to
      the wielder's Def against attacks made with slashing weapons. Speed is a percentile
      multiple to attack speed, while Threat specifies what range must be rolled on an
      attack roll naturally before any modifiers to score a threat. Crit is the damage
      multiplier on critical hits. Traits specifies any special qualities possessed
      by the weapon. Exotic weapons are marked with an asterisk.\n
      <weapon table>\n\n
      <11>Weapon Saving Throws<3>\n
      __Some weapons have special effects that occur on a failed saving throw, such as
      stunning. The formula for calculating a weapon's saving throw DC is 10 + half the
      wielder's melee BAB, plus either the wielder's Strength modifier (knockdown,
      stunning) or Dexterity modifier (entangling, reach closing DC). The entangle DC
      also adds the weapon's Acc modifier, closing DC adds the weapon's Parry modifier
      and stun or knockdown add a custom modifier based on the weapon's size or weight.
      Characters not proficient with the weapon have a -4 penalty to this save DC,
      while weapon focus, specialization, mastery, high mastery and grand mastery
      each increase the DC by +2, culmulatively.";

     <11>LEARNING SPELLS {LE}\n
     ===============<3>\n
     __You can learn spells by typing 'L' or 'E' on the character
     sheet screen. This brings up a menu with all the possible spells you could
     learn at the moment; for clerics and druids, this is every unlearned spell
     of a level for which you currently have a free spell slot. For wizards, however,
     this list shows only the spells that you have a spellbook for somewhere in your
     inventory. If, after surveying the list, you don't find a spell you want, you
     can press [ESC] to cancel the menu and not learn any spell.\n\n
  
     <11>THE SPELL MANAGER AND SPELLCASTING {SM}\n
     ==================================<3>\n     
     __Pressing 'm' on the main gameplay screen brings up the spell manager
     window (assuming that the character knows at least one spell). This
     lists every spell known to the character at present, along with a brief
     description of the currently selected spell. The names of bonus spells
     granted by domains are shown in purple, while the names of all the other
     spells are grey.  The list can be scrolled through using the arrow keys, 
     and pressing either [ENTER] or the letter in the box causes the spell
     selected to be cast. Pressing [ESC] causes the spell manager window to
     vanish without casting a spell.\n
     __<11>Metamagic:<3> You can toggle the on/off state of any metamagic feat
     you have learned with regard to a single spell by typing the capital
     letter shown associated with it in the legend at the bottom of the spell
     manager window. The game remembers which metamagic feats you have turned
     on for any given spell between castings, so if you turn on Maximize Spell
     for a <9>fireball<3>, you need to turn it back off again on your next 
     casting if you don't want it. The total number of metamagic levels
     currently associated with a given spell are shown in square brackets beside
     the feat list, and the spell success rate is recalculated dynamically as
     you add or remove metamagic feats, to help you decide if you want to cast
     the spell that way or not.\n
     __<11>Spellkeys:<3> By pressing a number key (0-9) while a given spell is
     selected, you can assign that key to the spell in question as a keyboard
     shortcut. Then, on the main game panel you can press that key to cast the
     spell in question at any time without needing to bring up the spell manager
     first. The letter in the box beside the spell will change to a number to
     confirm the assignment of the spellkey.\n
     __<11>Casting Requisites:<3> In order to cast a spell, some classes need to
     have a certain item. Mages must have a spellbook that contains the spell in
     question somewhere in their inventory, while priests must have their holy
     symbol equipped in their amulet slot in order to cast spells. In addition,
     a caster must have one hand free in order to perform the somatic components
     of spellcasting, and since spells also have verbal incantations, they cannot
     be cast in areas of magical silence. These requirements can be negated by
     using the Inherent Spell, Still Spell and Vocalize Spell feats respectively.\n
     __<11>Spell Success Rate:<3> All spells have a base chance of succeeding
     when cast; this value is usually somewhere between 70~ and 90~. This value
     is adjusted by +/-5~ for every point of your primary Intelligence modifier,
     and +2~ for every caster level you have above the minimum caster level required
     to cast the given spell. The spell success chance for arcane spells is heavily
     penalized by wearing armour, and conditions that make it difficult to concentrate
     (such as being grappled, or being inside the area of effect of an <9>insect plague<3>
     spell) penalize spellcasting of all types.\n
     __If the final chance of spell success is above 90~, it is adjusted downward.
     Every 10~ above 90~ becomes an additional +1~ chance of spell success, so a
     spell with a calculated 130~ chance of succeeding would be adjusted down to
     have a success rate of 94~. No spell can ever have a success rate above 98~,
     regardless.\n\n
     
     <11>MANA {MA}\n
     ====<3>\n
     __Incursion differs from its parent system (but hews to roguelike convention)
     in that spells are cast by spending mana -- a form of magical energy -- rather
     than depending on spell preparation and spells per day. Mana is measured in a
     manner similar to hit points, with a permanent maximum and a current total.
     Characters gain new mana every level; mages also begin with a magical item that
     increases the size of their maximum mana pool, because they have to depend on
     spellcasting more than other character types. Casting spells, using innate
     spell-like abilities and blasting wands all consume a character's mana supply.
     Every spell has a mana cost associated with it, and most characters simply pay
     that cost whenever they cast that spell. Mages, however, find the mana cost of
     spells adjusted by their specialty school modifiers, as described under Schools
     of Magic, below.\n
     __Mana normally replenishes fully when characters rest for the night. Further,
     mana may regenerate slowly over time. If a character's mana pool is half or
     more empty, it will not regenerate at all until she rests. If it is more than
     half full, however, the character will regain mana over time at a speed based 
     on the proportion of her total mana she has spent. In other words, a character
     down only a little mana will recover quickly, whereas one down more will take
     exponentially longer to recover. The AutoRest macro can be used to rest until
     mana is recovered safety -- holding down the Rest key risks being attacked by
     surprise and being unable to respond, resulting in seemingly random death.\n
     __Some spells, such as <9>resist fire<3> and <9>bull's strength<3>, offer
     protection or enhancement that lasts a full day. Mana spent on these spells
     is referred to as <11>held mana<3> and never regenerates, and the character's 
     total pool is counted as being that many points lower for determining if and 
     how quickly a character regenerates mana. For example, if a character with 100 
     mana spends thirty points on self-enhancement spells, she can spend another 35 
     mana points on attack or miscellaneous spells before her pool reaches the point 
     it will no longer regenerate, because her total mana pool not counting held 
     mana is 70. On the mana bar in the traits window, held mana is shown in brown.
     \n\n

     <11>METAMAGIC {ME}\n
     =========<3>\n
     __Metamagic allows the hero to modify the effects of spells that she casts. The
     first step to using metamagic is to learn one or more of the metamagic feats.
     All of the metamagic feats end in 'Spell' (Maximize Spell, Still Spell, Warp
     Spell, etc.), so they are easy to recognize in the feat list. Every metamagic
     feat added to a spell costs a certain number of metamagic levels, as shown on 
     the table below. Metamagic levels stack for multiple feats, and have the
     following effects:\n
     __<7>*<3>_Every metamagic level a spell has attached to it costs the caster 
     one fatigue point whenever the spell is cast.\n
     __<7>*<3>_The spell success rate for a given spell is decreased by 10~ for every
     metamagic level placed on it. This is done before the adjustment for spell
     success rates above 90~ is made, so a spell that shows a 94~ spell success
     rate in the spell manager window can afford to have 4 metamagic levels attached
     to it without dropping the adjusted success rate below 90~.\n
     __<7>*<3>_The mana cost for casting a spell increases by 50~ or 3 points,
     whichever is higher, for every metamagic level attached to the spell.\n
     __High rating in the Metamagic skill can reduce the mana increase and the fatigue
     cost of metamagicked spells. The number of metamagic levels that each feat adds
     are shown in the following table:<15>
     \n__Metamagic Feat_________Lev__Metamagic Feat_________Lev<1>
     \n__Amplify Spell___________2___Inherent Spell__________1
     \n__Augment Summoning_______2___Maximize Spell__________3

    <15>Schools of Magic {SC}\n
    ================\n
    <3>__Arcane magic in Incursion is grouped into nine schools, of which a
    mage character may choose to specialize in one. Every school choice
    makes for a mage with a distinctly different flavour.\n\n

    <11>Spell Failure Modifiers\n
    =======================\n
    <3>__Each specialist type has a distinct set of modifiers toward
    casting spells from different schools; of course, the best value
    always rests in the school that the specialist chose as his primary
    school. These modifiers are as follows:<15>

    \n____________Abj__Arc__Div__Enc__Evo__Ill__Nec__Tha__Wea__
    \n<7>Abjurer_____<1>+25~_+15~_+15~_---__-10~_---__-30~_-15~_+10~_
    \n<7>Arcanist____<1>---__+25~_+10~_---__---__+10~_---__---__+10~_
    \n<7>Diviner_____<1>---__+10~_+25~_---__-15~_-10~_---__---__---__
    \n<7>Enchanter___<1>+15~_-10~_---__+25~_-15~_+10~_---__+10~_---__
    \n<7>Evoker______<1>+10~_---__-20~_-15~_+25~_-20~_-15~_+5~__---__
    \n<7>Illusionist_<1>---__+20~_+10~_+10~_-25~_+25~_-15~_-10~_+15~_
    \n<7>Necromancer_<1>-10~_---__+15~_-10~_---__-20~_+25~_+15~_---__
    \n<7>Thaumaturge_<1>+5~__---__-10~_+10~_-10~_-15~_+15~_+25~_+5~__
    \n<7>Weaver______<1>+15~_+10~_+10~_-10~_---__---__-15~_-15~_+25~_
    \n\n__<3>In addition to affecting the spell success chance, the school
    modifiers have two other impacts on casting. A positive modifier
    decreases the mana cost by 5~ for every 5~ of the modifier, but a
    negative modifier increases the mana cost by <11>50~<3> for every
    five percent of the modifier. Thus, a Thaumaturge suffers doubled
    mana costs when casting Illusion spells. Furthermore, a negative
    school modifier acts as a percentile chance that casting the spell
    in question will be draining, costing the caster a point of fatigue
    in the process of casting.
    
    \n\n
    <11>Abjuration<3> {AB}\n
    __This school focuses on protection, banishment and warding. Its a
    good specialty for those who want a highly defensive, cautious style
    of play. High-level Abjurers tend to be nearly impossible to harm,
    but lack the powerful offensive and miscellanea spells that other
    mages typically have. Abjurers are often also called White Wizards,
    given the benevolent nature of their magic, and are the most trusted
    of mages by the common people. Spells which best represent the nature 
    of this school include <9>dispel magic<3>, <9>resist fire<3>, 
    <9>banishment<3> and <9>globe of invulnerability<3>.\n
    __Abjurers are also strong in the schools of Weavecraft, Divination
    and Arcana, but are weaker than average wielding spells of Evocation,
    Necromancy and Thaumaturgy.\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Abjurers gain a +1 insight bonus to all
    three of their saving throws at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th levels.
    Additionally, because of the defensive and protective nature of their
    magic, Abjurers receive access to several spells from the priest spell
    list: <9>sanctuary<3>, <9>detect evil<3>, <9>shield other<3>, <9>glyph
    of warding<3>, <9>remove curse<3> (as a 3rd-level spell), <9>negative
    plane protection<3>, <9>death ward<3>, <9>free action<3>, <9>spell
    immunity<3>, <9>magic resistance<3>, <9>dispel evil<3>, <9>antilife
    shell<3> and <9>glyph of warding, greater<3>. They cast these spells
    as arcane spells, receiving a special spellbook containing them at the
    beginning of the game.\n\n

    <11>Arcana<3> {AR}\n
    __Certainly the most diverse of the nine schools, Arcana concerns
    those spells which manipulate the environment or change the parameters
    of a situation indirectly. Arcana spells are rarely powerful
    per se, but they are highly useful; Arcanists are the generalists
    of the mage world, with a number of unusual tricks up their sleeves.
    Archetypical Arcana spells include <9>wall of fog<3>, <9>web<3>, 
    <9>animate objects<3> and <9>major creation<3>.\n
    __Arcanists are also mildly above average performing spells from
    the schools of Illusion, Divination and Weavecraft, but their
    greatest edge is that they are not <11>below<3> average in any of the
    schools at all!\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> The strength of the Arcanist is not power
    but diversity. Arcanists are competant with every school, having no
    negative modifiers on the spell chart.\n\n   

    <11>Divination<3> {DI}\n
    __Divination spells reveal information to the caster -- they can be
    very difficult to base a character around, but can make the game
    much, much easier in many places. A Diviner is able to track down
    powerful magic items, avoid encounters she feels she can't win, and
    mystically discern what form of attacks will be the most effective
    against any given threat. Typical spells include <9>detect monsters<3>,
    <9>perception<3>, <9>clairvoyance<3> and <9>true seeing<3>.\n
    __Diviners also excel at spells of Weavecraft, Arcana and Thaumaturgy, 
    but are mediocre when handling Evocations and Illusions.\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Drawn from the ranks of sages and scholars,
    Diviners receive three extra skill points at every mage level, and gain
    a +1 insight bonus to Intelligence at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th
    levels. They gain access to the spell <9>detect monsters<3> as a 2nd,
    not 3rd, level spell. (Once more priestly Divinations are implemented, the
    Diviners will also have access to spells like <9>augury<3> and of course
    <9>divination<3>, just like Abjurers do now.)\n\n

    <11>Enchantment<3> {EN}\n
    __These spells imbue a target's internal nature with magic -- either
    they affect a living target's mind, or they imbue an object (typically
    a weapon) with purely magical properties, without changing its
    physical nature. An Enchanter is very effective in turning enemies
    into allies, boosting his weapons and convincing others to fight
    for his cause, but is in grave danger when facing undead and mindless
    creatures. Typical spells include <9>charm person<3>, <9>hold monster<3>, 
    <9>minor malison<3> and <9>eyebite<3>.\n
    __Enchanters find that Illusion, Thaumaturgy and Abjuration are
    natural compliments to their chosen school, but lack skill with the
    more blunt magics of Evocation and Arcana.\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Enchanters gain the Beguiling Magic ability,
    which allows them to add their primary Charisma modifier to the save DC
    of their mind-affecting spells. They also gain Diplomacy as a bonus
    class skill, allowing them to convince creatures they charm into doing
    things to serve their agenda.\n
    __Enchanters also have access to the priest spell <9>enthrall<3>, which
    they cast as arcane magic.\n\n

    <11>Evocation<3> {EV}\n
    __Wanna blow stuff up? This is the school for you, and because it
    has the most powerful offensive spells in the game, it grants a very
    straightforward playing style, making it a good choice for players
    new to Incursion. Evocations manipulate or create energy and natural
    forces; infamous Evocation spells include <9>magic missile<3>, <9>fireball<3>,
    <9>wall of force<3> and <9>shield<3>.\n
    __Evokers find the subtler magics of Divination, Illusion, Necromancy
    and Enchantment difficult to manage, but are very comfortable with
    the powerful and direct spells of Abjuration and Thaumaturgy.\n
    __<11>Specialist Ability:<3> Evokers channel raw magical energies
    through their bodies far more frequently than other mages, relying
    on draining metamagic feats like Empower, Quicken and Maximize. To
    support this penchant, their maximum total Fatigue Points increases
    by one every even mage level.\n\n

    <11>Illusion<3> {IL}\n
    __Illusion magic is indirect and deceptive, creating images of things
    that aren't real and, at the higher levels of power, weaving shadow
    matter into quasi-real constructs of will. Illusionists are similar to
    Weavers in that they fight indirectly, relying on keeping their enemy
    occupied at a distance. The illusionist gains some very powerful
    miscellanea spells, but lacks the direct power of the evoker or the
    necromancer. Its a choice best suited to a patient and tactical
    player. Spells typical of the Illusion school include <9>invisibility<3>,
    <9>phantasmal force<3> and <9>shadow monsters<3>.\n
    __Illusionists excel at Weavecraft, Divination, Arcana and Enchantment, 
    but are weaker in the schools of Evocation, Necromancy and Thaumaturgy.\n
    __<11>Specialist Ability:<3> To complement their penchant for trickery and
    ability to utilize <9>invisibility<3>, Illusionists receive Bluff, Move
    Silently, Pick Pockets and Disguise as bonus mage class skills. They also
    receive a +1 competence bonus to the Illusioncraft skill every even mage
    level.\n\n

    <11>Necromancy<3> {NE}\n
    __Long viewed as the darkest of the schools, this profane art relates
    to the manipulation of negative energy -- the causes and effects of
    death, and the creation of undead. Necromancers are widely feared, but
    they are also tremendously useful -- much of the manual labour on Therya
    is performed by raised undead, no matter how much the Church of Immotian
    might protest. Thus, like the mortician that came before him, the 
    Necromancer is a scorned but nonetheless essential element of modern 
    society. Spells typical of the school of Necromancy include <9>chill touch<3>,
    <9>horrid wilting<3> and of course, <9>animate dead<3>.\n
    __Necromancers are strong in Thaumaturgy and Divination, and weaker only
    in Enchantment, Illusion and Abjuration.\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Necromancers receive a bonus pool of hit dice
    worth of created undead they can control that do not count toward the
    normal maximum of summoned/charmed/animated/etc. creatures a mage may
    have under his control before they start to break free. Necromancers
    also receive a +1 bonus to save vs. death magic at every 3rd level, gain
    a +2 bonus to save vs. fear at 1st level (due to the exceptionally...
    grim situations they are exposed to and treat Poison Use as a bonus 
    class skill.\n
    __Finally, Necromancers gain access to certain signature spells at
    lower levels than other mages: <9>animate dead<3> as a 3rd level
    spell, <9>create corporeal undead<3> at 5th and <9>create spectral
    undead<3> at 6th.\n\n

    <11>Thaumaturgy<3> {TH}\n
    __Thaumaturgy is magic that alters the composition or properties of 
    living creatures. Because so many of its spells focus on physical
    self-empowerment, it makes an ideal specialization for multi-classed
    Warrior-Mages. Spells typical of the school include <9>bull's strength<3>,
    <9>polymorph self<3>, <9>enlarge<3> and <9>Tenser's transformation<3>.\n
    __Thaumaturges are also skilled with the schools of Abjuration, Enchantment,
    Weavecraft and Necromancy, but find the magics of Evocation, Illusion and
    Divination more difficult to grasp.\n
    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Thaumaturges embrace life in all its splendour,
    shattering the stereotype of the mage as an ivory tower academic. Their
    penchant for physical combat and hardier lifestyle give them 1d8 hit points
    every mage level instead of 1d4. Furthermore, they are proficient with all
    light weapons, instead of the normal, more limited choices available to
    mages.\n\n

    <11>Weavecraft<3> {WE}\n
    __Weavecraft spells deal with distance, location and the innate nature
    of magic; they can summon creatures or augment other spells. The school
    lends itself to a 'cheap tricks' style of play, so players may choose
    or avoid it based on whether they prefer such to a more normal game.

    __<11>Specialist Bonus:<3> Weavers are able to control their destination

    <15>Multiclass Spellcasters {MU}\n
    =======================\n    
    __<3>Incursion handles multiclass spellcasters in a somewhat more nuanced
    way than its parent game system. To single-classed mages, clerics or druids,
    these differences are effectively invisible, but when playing a spellcaster
    with more than one class, understanding how to use them effectively becomes
    very important. To understand this, it's important to distinguish between
    the following two concepts -- the difference is imperceptible to single-
    classed spellcasters, but significant to multiclassed ones.\n
    __<15>Caster Levels:<3> A caster level represents one stage of skill in
    spellcasting, abstract of any specific kind of spellcasting (such as bardic
    magic, paladin magic, etc.) Different classes gain caster levels at a
    different rate -- a mage gains one caster level for every mage level,
    while a paladin gains one caster level for every even paladin level
    starting at 4th. Caster levels, once gained, are independant of whatever
    class they were gained from, and caster levels from different classes
    always stack. Thus, for example, a mage 5 / paladin 4 has six total
    caster levels; 5 from mage and one from paladin. The Intensive Study
    feat can be used to gain more caster levels in some circumstances.\n
    __Caster levels determine two things: the power of a caster's spells
    and the spell slots she has access to. For example, the spell <9>fireball<3>
    inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level -- thus, the mage/paladin
    example above would be able to throw a <9>fireball<3> inflicting 6d6
    points of damage (saving throw abiding, of course). Caster levels also
    affect most spells' range and duration. Secondly, caster levels determine
    the number of spell slots characters have which they can spend to learn
    spells. The following chart shows how many spell slots for every spell
    level a character with a given number of caster levels has access to:\n
    <15>__Caster________Spell Slots By Level\n

    __<3>This table is modified by bonus slots gained from Intelligence and
    other factors, and does not include bones slots gained from the Mage
    Magical Diversity class feature or the free domain spells clerics gain.
    Regardless of Intelligence, however, note that no character can begin
    casting spells of a given level until they have enough caster levels to
    gain their first slot for that spell level on the above chart -- thus,
    for example, no character can cast 4th level spells until they have
    accumulated 7 caster levels from any combination of classes.\n
    __<15>Spell Access:<3> Distinct from the concept of caster levels is
    the idea of spell access, though because spell access usually advances
    faster than caster levels this distinction is normally imperceptible to
    single-class casters. While caster levels are uniform -- the same no
    matter what class they are gained from -- spell access is specific to
    a given class. Paladin magic is different from bardic magic; every class
    has associated with it a list of spells that its members gain access to.
    Paladins have spells associated with righteous might, bards with knowledge,
    trickery and social influence, clerics with protection and community, and
    so forth. A single spell's level can vary on different spell lists -- for
    example, <9>call light<3> is a first-level priest spell and a second-level
    mage spell.\n
    __Mages are a special case -- because their spell list is so huge and broad,
    and represents such a major element of their class abilities, it is broken
    up into to parts to determine spell access. Mages gain access to all the
    spells from their specialty school at a mage class level equal to the level
    of the spell in question. They then gain access to all the rest of their
    spells at the mage class level that equals the caster level when they first
    gain a slot for a spell of that level. Thus, a 5th-level Thaumaturge has
    access to all first through fifth-level Thaumaturgy spells as well as all
    other 1st, 2nd and 3rd-level arcane spells.\n
    __Bards, clerics and druids gain access to the spells on their class spell 
    lists at a rate of one spell level per class level; this is basically the
    standard approach, and applies to most prestige classes with their own spell
    list as well. Thus, a fifth-level druid has access to all first through
    fifth level druid spells, even though a <11>single-classed<3> fifth-level
    druid will only have the spell slots to learn spells from the first through
    third spell levels. The 'minor casters' - paladins and rangers - gain access
    to their spell lists at a rate of one spell level per class level starting at
    third level -- so a fifth level ranger has access to 1st, 2nd and 3rd-level
    ranger spells, despite only having enough caster levels from ranger to be
    able to cast 1st-level spells.\n
    __In addition to determining what spells a character can place in her spell
    slots, spell access determines what restrictions a character has on casting
    those spells. For example, clerics must have a holy symbol to cast a spell,
    but can cast spells in armour, while mages suffer severe penalties for casting
    spells in armour, have their success chances adjusted by specialist modifiers
    and must possess a spellbook with the spell in it to cast it. So consider the
    cast of a priest 1/mage 1 who knows <9>chromatic orb<3>, <9>bless<3> and
    <9>magic weapon<3>. <9>Chromatic orb<3> is a mage spell, so she must have a spellbook
    to cast it, gains the specialist modifier regardless of whether it's good or
    bad and suffers penalties to her casting if she does it in armour. When she
    casts <9>bless<3>, however, she gains no specialist bonus or penalty, is
    able to cast freely in armour and needs a holy symbol.\n
    __<9>Magic weapon<3> is an odd case, since it is on both the mage and priest
    spell lists as a 1st-level spell. When this is the case, the caster gains
    the best of both (or all) worlds -- she can cast the spell in armour without
    penalty, gains either her mage specialist modifier or a 0~ modifier (whichever
    favours her more) and can choose to use either a spellbook or a holy symbol as
    her focus for the spell.\n\n
    
    <15>Practical Examples<3>\n
    __Consider the following characters to illustrate how multi-class spellcasters
    function in practice in Incursion.\n
    __<11>Dominus, Mage (Necromancer) 3 / Priest 4:<3> Dominus has 7 caster levels,
    so according to the chart above he knows 5 1st level spells, 4 2nd leve, 3 3rd
    level and 1 4th level. Since his level as a priest is 4th, he has access to the
    priest spell list up to 4th level. As a 3rd-level mage, he has access to all
    arcane Necromancy spells up to 3rd spell level, as well as all other arcane
    spells up to 2nd level (because a 3rd-level single class mage could cast only
    1st and 2nd level spells). Therefore, he chooses his 1st and 2nd level spells
    from the full combined mage and priest lists, and he can choose his 3rd-level
    spells from both the mage Necromancy spells or any priest spells. His single
    4th-level spell must be chosen from the priest list, however, unless he wants
    to save the slot until he goes up another level as a mage, in which case he
    could also place a 4th-level Necromantic mage spell in that level.\n
    __Despite this tremendous flexibility, however, Dominus certainly does pay a
    price for his multiclassing -- it's important to remember that class features
    are determined only by class level, not by caster level or character level. So,
    Dominus only has the ability to cast 1st and 2nd level domain spells -- he'll
    gain third-level domain spells when he takes his 5th priest level. Likewise,
    he has the 2 bonus slots mages get only for 1st and 2nd level spells (though
    he can use them for any spells he wants, including priest spells), and he does
    not gain the bonus metamagic feat a single-classed mage would have gained at
    mage class level 5.\n
    __<11>Lady Sarah, Thaumaturge 3 / Warrior 5:<3> In order to enhance her
    ability as a spellcaster, Lady Sarah has bought the Intensive Study feat
    three times to increase her caster levels, giving her six total caster
    levels. However, this feat does not affect her spell access at all. As
    such, she has 4/3/2 known spells. As a Thaumaturge 3, she can choose the
    1st and 2nd level spells from the full mage list, but she can only choose
    Thaumaturgy spells for her third-level slots. Note that she's effectively
    reached the point of diminishing returns with Intensive Study -- she could
    take more warrior levels and buy the feat again,and it would give her a
    fourth-level spell slot -- but because she has no spell access to fourth
    level spells of any kind, the slot would remain unspent and useless to her.\n
    __Likewise, a character design of Mage 3 / Priest 3 / Druid 3 would be highly
    suboptimal -- such a character would have caster level 9 and thus access to
    4th and 5th level spell slots, but would have no spell access to any spells
    above spell level 3, so those slots would be wasted. Obviously, only so much 
    diversity and mixing is possible before it becomes simply dilution.\n\n
    
    <15>Using Magical Items {IT}\n
    ===================\n<3>    
    __There are many different classes of magical items in Incursion, and some
    have hidden elements or features. This discusses the basics of using the
    more common classes.\n\n
    
    <15>Identifying Items<3>\n
    __When items are first found in the dungeon, your character will have no
    idea what their purpose is. She can try using them, though that carries
    with it a risk -- there exist items that bear powerful curses that can
    weaken or endanger your character. Alternatively, she can wait until she
    locates a source of magic that identifies items, such as the relatively
    common Scrolls of Identify. The Intuition skill also aides in learning
    about magical items.\n
    __Sometimes unidentified items have an adjective before their name -- a
    'bronze wand' or 'murky potion'. All items of a given type described in
    this manner usually appear the same way, so if one crimson potion is a
    Potion of Healing, every crimson potion will be a Potion of Healing.
    Once your character tries out a crimson potion and discovers what it is,
    no more 'crimson potions' will appear; instead, they will be known as
    Potions of Healing when you first see them.\n
    __This knowledge isn't constant across different games, however -- just
    because a 'crimson potion' was Healing in one game doesn't mean that it
    won't be a Potion of Poison in the next.\n\n 

    <15>Depth and Plusses<3>\n
    __Some magical items have a plus associated with them -- a Wand +1 of
    Scouring, or a short sword +2. A plus is a measure of a magical item's
    power; items with higher plusses tend to show up at a deeper depth in
    dungeons than items with lower plusses. All items of the same type
    have the same function, but those with higher plusses perform that
    function with a greater magnitude -- more damage, higher DCs to saving
    throws, more powerful creatures summoned, etc.\n\n
    
    <15>Weapons, Armour and Shields<3>\n
    __In order to benefit from a magical weapon or suit of armour, all that
    you need to do is equip the item in the proper inventory slot, and their
    benefit will last until the item is removed. Some weapons or armour only 
    grant their benefits to a wielder or wearer who is proficient with the
    weapon or class of armour in question.\n
    __The plus of a magical weapon is added directly to attack and damage
    rolls made with that weapon, making the wielder more likely to hit foes
    and causing her to inflict more damage when she does. The magical plus
    of armour is added to the armour rating of the armour in all three categories.
    The magical plus of a shield is added to the Def bonus it grants.\n
    __The information below concerning worn items can also apply to weapons
    and armour in some cases.\n\n
    
    <15>Helms, Bracers, Boots, Cloaks, Lenses, Headbands, Rings, etc.<3>\n
    __Most wearable items are activated simply by putting an item on. If you
    wear an item you have not identified and it grants you some form of bonus,
    that bonus will not show up on your character sheet, but it will be used
    by the game behind the scenes. If you are fighting or otherwise making
    rolls and you notice that the numbers don't add up, chances are you may
    be wearing an unidentified item that is giving you a bonus (or penalty)
    of some kind.\n
    __Some of these sorts of items can be activated by a spoken command
    word to perform an effect, rather than bestowing a constant bonus. In
    this case, they can't be used until they have been conclusively identified
    using magic -- until this is done, the character has no way to know what
    the command word is, even if Intuition gives the player basically all the
    information needed to conclusively identify the item. To activate such an
    item, use the Activate ('a') command.\n
    __Normally, only one item of a given type can be worn -- if the character
    tried to wear two cloaks or two pairs of bracers, neither would function.
    The exceptions are rings (one ring can be worn on the ring finger on each
    hand), and cloaks and robes (the character can wear either a magical cloak
    <11>or<3> a magical robe, not both, despite there being different inventory
    slots for each).\n
    __A few powerful worn items (often rings, armour or weapons) grant benefits
    that do not take effect until the character has rested with them on, or
    worn them for a full day, or what have you -- their benefits would be too
    easy to exploit if they could be easily swapped in and out with other
    items. The <11>Ring of Regeneration<3> is an example of such an item.\n\n 
    
    <15>Stones<3>\n
    __Stones work in most ways like worn items, granting their bearer a
    continual benefit. However, to gain this benefit the wearer needs to
    simply carry the stone with them -- either in her hands or in one of
    the belt inventory slots -- rather than wearing it. The magic of a
    stone is ineffective if it is placed within a backpack or other such
    container, however.\n\n
    
    <15>Potions<3>\n
    __Any character can benefit from a magical potion; it requires no special
    skill to do so. Potions can be drunk using the Quaff ('q') command. Some
    potions are meant for other uses than drinking, however, and drinking them
    at the very least wastes them and can have a detrimental effect on the
    character. The most common case of this is Oils, which are meant to be
    applied to weapons or armour to enhance their function. These can be used
    by selecting the Apply option from the Yuse ('y') menu.\n\n
    
    <15>Scrolls<3>\n
    __Reading a scroll is based on the Decipher Script skill, and the writeup
    for that skill contains the specific mechanics. However, even a character
    without ranks in Decipher Script has a resonable chance to successfully
    read a low to mid-level scroll. To try to read a scroll, use the Read ('r')
    command.\n\n
    
    <15>Wands<3>\n
    __Using a wand is based on the Use Magic skill, and the writeup for that 
    skill contains the specific mechanics. However, even a character without 
    ranks in Use Magic has a resonable chance to successfully use a low-level 
    wand. To try to use a wand, use the Blast ('b') command.\n
    __Almost all wands have a magical plus associated with them. If the wand
    inflicts damage, it will typically do a set amount of damage with the 
    number of dice rolled multiplied by its plus. If it requires a saving
    throw, the DC typically increases by +2 for every plus the wand has.\n
    __Gnomes are extremely proficient with wands and begin play with
    several of them.\n\n
    
     <15>Staves<3>\n
     <3>__Staves are typically the province of higher-level mages,
     and are one of the more powerful classes of items found in the
     game. Normally, a character must have a certain minimum number
     of levels as a mage before they can access the powers of a
     given staff, ranging from a single mage level (for weaker staves
     like the <9>staff of size alteration<3>) to a maximum of seven
     mage levels (to access the full powers of a <9>staff of the 
     magi<3>). Some staves, notably the <9>staff of the woodlands<3>,
     are attuned to other classes (in this case the druid). As always,
     rogues of sufficient level can use the Trick Magic ability to
     handle staves effectively.    
     <3>__A staff's most common power is granting access to a number
     of spells, often tied to a theme related to the staff in question.
     If the staff-bearer does not actually know these spells, she may
     cast them just as if she did -- the normal mana cost applies, but
     like the innate magical abilities of certain monsters, there is
     no chance of failure. Casting spells from a staff in this manner
     does consume charges from the staff, however. The caster level is
     the better of the wielder's own or the staff's item level.\n
     <3>__If the staff-bearer is normally able to cast a spell granted
     by a staff, however, the staff augments the casting. The bearer
     has a 100% success chance with that spell, even if metamagic feats
     are applied to it (though it does not remove the increased mana
     cost or fatigue cost of the metamagic), and casting the spell does
     not consume charges from the staff, nor require any somatic action.\n
     <3>__Spells can be cast from a staff using the Spell Manager the
     same way that a spellcaster normally casts them. Spells from a staff
     appear in the listing in green -- dark green if granted exclusively
     by the staff, or bright green if the staff augments existing
     knowledge of the spell. In order to make effective use of a staff's
     spells (and other powers), however, a mage must have it in his hands
     -- in the Weapon Hand or Ready Hand slots (or both) in the Inventory
     Manager. Fortunately, most staves are magical weapons in their own
     right, acting as a cudgel or quarterstaff with a magical bonus to
     strike and damage, usually +1 or +2.\n
     <3>__Certain staves have other powers beyond augmenting spells,
     sometimes granting constant benefits like resistances, attribute
     boosts or the ability to see invisible creatures just by being
     held. Others grant completely unique magical abilities that work
     like spells, but are on no class's spell list (such as the
     <9>whirlwind<3> ability of the <9>staff of power<3>). A few
     staves can also be activated for some kind of unique effect,
     such as the infamous, catastrophic Retributive Strike.\n\n
     
     <15>Rods<3>\n
     __Rods can have functions similar to wands, staves or wonderous
     items, but are typically geared toward more militant characters
     than staves, which have requirements on caster level or spell
     access. Some rods can be used by anyone, while others might
     require a certain Base Attack Bonus to use successfully. Most
     rods can't be used until identified, but some might grant an
     effect just by being held.\n
     __Some rods are used via the Activate ('a') command, while others
     add extra effects to Spell Manager ('m') the same way that staves
     do.\n\n
     
     <15>Tomes<3>\n
     __Tomes are tremendously rare, valuable items. They must be
     identified magically to be usable, but once they have been they
     can be read using the Activate ('a') command. Tomes may only be
     read once, and vanish once read. However, they are much treasured
     because they grant permanent benefit to a character in the form
     of innate abilities, free experience points, or most commonly
     inherent bonuses to an attribute. Any given attribute cannot have
     an inherent bonus exceeding +5, regardless of the number of tomes
     read -- unless the reader is human, in which case the maximum
     bonus rises to +8.\n\n
     
     <15>Wonderous Items<3>\n
     __Some items defy all attempts to characterize them -- bowls which
     summon elementals, beads that aid a priest in his spellcasting,
     carpets that fly through the sky... the possibilities are endless.
     These items typically need to be identified to be used, and some
     are subject to the Activate ('a') command -- check the specific
     item for details on how it is used."; }

     =====================<6>\n
     -- {MM:mainmenu} Return to the Main Help Menu\n
     __Skills work slightly differently in Incursion than they do in its
     parent system. Characters can gain access to different skills in
     three ways: by having one or more levels in a class which has a given
     skill as a class skill, by selecting a race that has the skill as a
     racial skill or by choosing the Natural Aptitude feat, allowing the
     player to choose any skill as an extra skill. Some functions of some
     skills can be performed untrained (such as using Intuition to get a
     feeling about items, or using Jump to cross a distance by leaping),
     while most others actually require a character to have the skill,
     regardless of whether it comes from race, class or feat.\n
     __In addition to the binary state of either having a skill or not,
     every skill has a skill rating associated with it, being a sum total
     of various bonuses associated with the skill. Characters receive a
     +2 training bonus to every skill they have; if they have a given
     skill as both a race and class skill, this bonus increases to +3.\n\n

     <14>Skill Ranks and Points<6>\n
     __For every level a character has in
     a class, they receive an alottment of skill points that may be distributed
     among the skills of that class, or any class-independant skills the
     character has from race or feats. The base number of available skill
     points gained per level in a class is then adjusted by the character's
     Intelligence modifier; if the character gains 8 or more skill points
     per class level, the Intelligence modifier is doubled (if positive).
     A point invested in a skill becomes a rank in
     that skill; the maximum number of ranks a character can have in any
     class skill is determined by the sum total levels a character has in
     classses which have that skill as a class skill. For racial skills and
     skills gained from feats, the maximum number of ranks is determined
     based upon total character level.\n
     <15>___Levels__Max Ranks__|_Class______Skill Points<1>\n

     __<6>When a character is initially created, all the points gained for the
     first level in their chosen class must be spent before play begins.
     Thereafter, however, any additional levels gained give additional
     skill points that can be saved and spent at any time the player
     desires. Points from different classes are stored in different totals,
     because they can only be spent on skills associated with the class
     that granted them.\n\n
     
     <14>Familiar Skills<6>\n
     __Certain skills below are tagged as [Familiar]. While there are some
     races and classes that excel at these, they are things that any
     adventurer may find need to learn to some extent. As such, any
     character can invest up to their character level in ranks (maximum 5)
     in any of these skills, even if they do not have that skill as a class
     skill. Multiclass characters use their normally calculated max ranks
     or their character level, whichever favours them more, but the allowed
     ranks from familiarity do not stack with the rank cap from having the
     skill as a class skill.\n\n

     <14>Skill Rating and Skill Checks<6>\n
     __Your total proficiency with
     any given skill is called your Skill Level (sometimes 'Skill Rating')
     in that skill. It is the sum of an attribute modifier, your skill ranks
     and any other modifiers.\n
     __Each skill has an associated attribute and the secondary modifier
     for that attribute is part of your Skill Level. Some skills use
     the best or the worst of two attributes, others are always tied to a
     single attribute. The attribute that is currently modifying any given
     skill is always shown on your Character Sheet.\n
     __Every Skill Rank in a skill adds a +1 bonus to your Skill Level in
     that skill.\n
     __Other bonuses or penalties may apply. For example, Kobolds have a
     +4 racial bonus to Handle Device skill checks. As a second example,
     wearing full plate armour will apply a -6 armour penalty to Balance
     skill checks.\n
     __When you try to perform an action based on a skill, the game will
     roll 1d20 and add your skill rating, comparing the result to a set
     value called the Skill Check DC. If you equal or exceed the value,
     you pass the check; otherwise you fail. Often, the effectiveness of
     the action is determined by how high your skill roll is, rather than
     simply a binary pass/fail based on the skill DC. Some skill checks
     are shown at the bottom of the screen (and placed in the game log if
     the proper option is set), while others are made silently behind the
     scenes by the game, either to avoid revealing something to the player
     or simply to avoid 'message spam'.\n
     When rolling an Animal Empathy, ... check, the roll is made twice and
     the better result taken; the same benefit applies for any skill you
     have chosen the Skill Focus feat for. If you choose Skill Focus for
     one of the above-listed skills, you roll three times and take the best
     result. This is significant because being able to gain semi-reliable
     skill checks can be very valuable in a roguelike game.\n\n

     <14>Synergy Bonuses<6>\n    
     __Characters receive synergy bonuses to skills based on having invested
     ranks in skills related to the skill in question -- for example,
     learning Jump improves one's ability to Tumble as well. The synergy
     bonus is taken by taking the skill ranks of the influencing skill,
     dividing it by a set factor, and applying the result as a bonus to
     the original skill. All of the synergy bonuses in Incursion are
     listed in the table below:\n
     <15>__Skill_____________Synergy Bonus Granted<1>\n
     __Bluff_____________[Sense Motive Ranks / 3]\n

     <14>Differences from the OGL System<6>\n
     __Veteran gamers will note a few differences from Incursion's base
     system here. Points cannot be invested in 'cross-class' skills, maximum
     ranks grow rapidly initially and then slow down, no more points are
     gained at 1st character level than any other, and so forth. All of
     this is quite intentional -- Incursion characters are intended to
     start out specialized with ranks in only a few skills, and then grow
     to master more as the game progresses.\n\n

     <14>THE SKILL MANAGER {SM}\n
     =================<6>\n
     __The skill manager is relatively simple and straightforward to use.
     Your character has a pool of unspent skill ranks for the currently displayed
     class shown as asterisks at the top of the window. Skill points tentatively
     invested into skills are instead shown as asterisks in that skill's listing
     instead.\n
     __Press [Up] and [Down] to move up and down the skill list, and press
     [Right] to assign a single rank to a skill, or [Left] to remove an assigned
     rank from a skill. Pressing [Enter] will make the assigned ranks permanent
     and leave the skill manager after asking for confirmation, while pressing
     [Esc] will cancel any changes made and close the skill manager. A
     multiclass character can cycle through all the classes she has one or more
     levels in by pressing [Tab].\n
     __Pressing [PgDn] or [PgUp] will scroll the description of the currently
     selected skill shown, as usual with scrolling in Incursion.\n\n

     <14>THE SKILLS PROPER\n
     =================<6>\n
     __Here follows the full descriptions, with game effects, of all the
     skills in Incursion. Skills can have three types of uses:\n
     __<14>Active:<6> The player must actively choose to use the skill
     for it to come into play. Normally, this means that the skill will
     be listed by name on the Use Special Ability ('u') command's menu.\n
     __<14>Passive:<6> These skill uses are rolled (or modifiers applied)
     whenever an appropriate situation arises; they work for the player
     on a constant basis and no action needs to be taken to use them.\n
     __<14>Talking:<6> These skill uses are used to resolve the outcome
     of social actions initiated with the Talk ('t') command, but are
     otherwise like Active applications.\n";

Text "help::pantheon"
  { "__<7>There are many gods and spirits worshipped across the different
     lands of Therya. The thirteen true gods listed here form the primary
     pantheon which was first worshipped by the Vanyir, the human subrace
     that first settled in the Kinlands and has since spread to every
     corner of the land. Other pantheons exist, governing the far-off lands
     of Angla Maua, Arasaki, Kinsith Raegil and Koryama. There are alien
     powers of ooze, terror and darkness worshipped by the terrors of the
     Underdark, and the forever warring demon lords, archdevils and high
     celestial lords. But it is these 15 deities -- along with Maeve, the
     Queen of Faerie, and the foul spirits of the Demon Ghost Horde -- that
     are commonly known and worshipped in the Kinlands area.\n\n";}
