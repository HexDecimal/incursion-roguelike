      ogre magi must be throwbacks to the origin of the species at 
      the time of their fall, for their cruelty and amibition is
      matched only by their sophistication and culture.\n
      __Ogre magi possess a great magical inheritance, a gift of
      glory and intellect from ages long since past. While ogres
      are common in the Kinlands, ogre magi normally hail from
      far-distant Eastern lands known to no others and forever
      eclipsed in mist and shadow. They appear as perfectly
      manicured ogres, without the tusks, beetle brow or large ears 
      but with deep blue skin like the ocean at night, two tiny ivory
      horns on their forehead, sharp 
      intelligent eyes and agile fingers well suited 
      to somatic gestures. Most maintain a perfectly trimmed, long
      thin mustache and goatee beard, and dress in the richest
      fineries of empires long since passed into history.\n
      __Ogre magi are frequently cannibalistic, using duplicity
      and stealth to capture smaller humanoids to use as food
      reserves -- though they would never admit to this practice
      in casual conversation. When seeking food, they tend to
      bind their captives in cocoon-like cloth wrappings to carry
      over their backs. Many practice some form of martial
      arts, advancing in the monk class.";

  Nagas:

      Water nagas, the weakest of their kind, are detatched sensualists and
    hedonists, often trafficking in a variety of rare narcotic substances
    they use to seek out mystical experiences. They tend to be sociable,
    friendly and highly curious, but also surprisingly callous to the needs
    and desires of others. Water nagas are inclined toward neutrality, but
    they vary widely in alignment.
    
      Guardian nagas, the highest common caste of naga society, serve as
    great and terrible champions of light. Subtle in their weavings, they
    seek out sources of hidden darkness to oppose with their great store
    of occult knowledge. Many guardian nagas watch over ancient evils far
    more powerful then they, ensuring that they remain concealed from the
    prying eyes or interlopers.
    
      While most nagas are concerned with discovering secrets, dark nagas
    are rather more interested in preserving the communal secrets of the
    naga race. They are the assassins and spies of their species, operating
    from the shadows and answering to unseen lords and masters. They have
    a complex and ritualistic secret society of their own, to which they
    are fanatically loyal, and they follow arcane codes of honour dating
    back millenia. While nobody likes them, even the guardian nagas accept
    that the darks have a place within naga society.
                                 
      Spirit nagas, the most wicked of their race, are a grim and macabre
    breed. Trafficking in the souls of the dead, they draw humanoids away
    from the path of light with subtle deceptions and promises of occult
    secrets, then trap their spirits in gems when they die. Overly morbid
    in mindset and given to fatalistic outlooks, spirit nagas are usually
    shunned by the rest of their race.
    
    Elder Nagas:
      Crystal Naga (psionic, introspective, cultic)
      Ivory Naga (ressurection mythology, evil, renewal)
      Blood Naga (visceral, cycle of life, blood magic)
      Shroud Naga

      Their greatest contentment is found basking in the noonday
      sun, contemplating the greater mysteries in the waters of
      a lake or jungle. One of the oldest races on Theyra, they 
      have lifespans measured in centuries, and produce young 
      only very rarely and under special conditions. For this 
      reasson, they distrust humans and demihumans, though they 
      have long shared a friendship with the lizardfolk, with 
      whom they share more in common than they do with mammals.\n
      __Unlike the practicality of their cousins, grippli are
      much given to mysticism, exploration and even whimsy. They
      do not tend to embrace industry and are not capitalistic,
      but are very curious in spite of their caution. Legends
      claim that the grippli have built great, ancient hidden
      cities in the jungles of Theyra.\n
      __More and more frequently now young grippli are venturing
      away from these mythical cities to explore the rest of the
      world, and especially to delve underground. Grippli revere
      and worship the sun (and are especially sacred to Hesani,
      though Xavias respects them deeply as well), and thus see
      long sojourns into dark places to be a kind of purifying
      spiritual ordeal.\n
      __Grippli defend themselves with blowguns, daggers, snares
      and traps, as well as with the powers of their minds. Their 
      colouration allows them to blend into jungle terrain with
