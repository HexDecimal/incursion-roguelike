Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y16: 2015-03-01
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/1/: Implemented 'pain tolerance' feat.  Pull request submitted by thehouseoflai@Bitbucket.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/205/: Enabled sub-races support.  This was disabled but has now been reenabled, is untested and generally unsupported.   Pull request submitted by Thydron@Bitbucket.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/206/: GPLv2 violation within unused code compiled into the distribution binaries reported by johnny0@Bitbucket.  Rather than relying on compiler dead code removal, now the problematic file (the Accent compiler compiler runtime) is explicitly excluded from the distribution build
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/207/: Incursion domain name transfers.  Outstanding donations in the paypal account ($28.52US) have been used to fund transfer of the 'incursion-roguelike.org/.net/.com' domains from the original Incursion author, Julian.  This will prevent people finding the old stale domains which refer to old releases, and experiencing a more broken Incursion.  And will provide a better entrypoint than the bitbucket project page.  In the long term, the .net and .com domains may be discarded.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y15: 2014-12-23 (Festivus release)
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/4: Implemented 'amplify spell' metamagic feat.  This reduces the target's magic resistance by 25%.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/46/: Character sheet recall monster option allows a user to read a card detailing the selected monster type.  However, certain monster categories were not displaying correctly because the value was bumped 100000 as an indicator and the value's variable was an int16.  Reported by Stone_Dog@Bitbucket. 
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/44/: Added note to empty handed warning about ability to switch warning off in the options.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/179/: Legacy bug!  If you provide an assignment operator overload, then you should provide a matching copy constructor.  The reason for this is that you are sometimes likely to assign in a variable declaration, which uses the latter not the former.  Not providing the copy constructor, will do a bitwise copy which will result in this case in EventInfo instances sharing the same string references.  The first to get destroyed, will destroy the strings it thinks it owns, and either corruption or crashing will then happen.  Reported by Felius@Bay12.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/183/: If the user set 'Roguelike Keyset' to 'ON' and 'Shift Arrow Keys' to 'Run', shift and any of the 'vi keys' would not result in the player running.  This is an artifact of the move from Allegro to libtcod.  There's a special place in hell reserved for the SDL developers and their new API which goes lowest common denominator in order to cram in support for the mobile experience.  If someone presses 'h' it is a text event, if someone presses shift+'h' it is a key event with the shift modifier.  Ugh.  Reported by dck k, with reproduction case.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/185/: The victim oriented message shown to bystanders when an attack attempt was towards a weapon, rather than it's wielder, was about the actor rather than the victim.   This meant a mud elemental attacking a weapon would result in a message describing the weapon to be the mud elemental's rather than the wielders.  Reported by Georgy Vlasov.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/186/: 'One body, one soul' feat was intended to substitute best attribute value out of wisdom and constitution in some circumstances, but the code was wrong.  Reported by Karagy, with patch.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/187/: Doing an enter action via the 'y' use menu did not validate the target object type before sending the event, and the script engine would choke when it found that whatever it was the player was trying to enter, was not a portal.  Reported by Karagy, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/188/: Selecting an item from the inventory would crash if there were more than 100 items in there somewhere.  This was a hard-coded limit added in a previous bug fix, for some reason.  Now buffer is reallocated by enumeration function and problem goes away.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/189/: Precision strike had no range constraint, allowing it to be used against distant targets.  It uses the wielded weapon, otherwise the default attack of the racial type.  If the wielded weapon was ranged, then it was used as a brawl weapon naively.  For now precision strike cannot be used if the wielded weapon is ranged.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/190/: If a god is angry but decides to act later, then a stati was registered for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't checked if there was already such a stati from a previous decision to act and act later, so they accumulate and the maximum number of stati that can be present on the player is hit, resulting in a red box.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/191/: When people use the roguelike keyset, this overrides all the keys that comprise the roguelike keyset to do arrow key movements.  Unfortunately this means that any menu that expects these keys gets the movement character instead.  Including in this case, the learn spell option in the character sheet.  Now if roguelike keyset is in use, 'E' is advertised as the key instead of 'L'.  Reported by Thyme Oregano@Bitbucket.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/192/: Compilation warning fixes broke money transfers, resulting in bugged amounts being transferred due to signed/unsigned variable interaction.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/193/: Compilation warning fixes broke casted touch attacks, resulting in crashes.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/194/: Compilation warning fixes broke praying for aid.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/195/: Observed messages where the action for some reason could be observed, but the actor could not be identified, would report the action as 'It blah blah..' as a substitution for 'The thing blah blah..'.  Now, the message observed is 'Something blah blah..' in this case.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/196/: When someone successfully counterspells, they get the act factored into when their next action happens, as a delay. The problem was that counterspell has benefits over and above the advertised ones, where the delay is reduced as the skill level of counterspell increases. This then goes negative at a certain level, and puts the player out of commission with a permanent timeout.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/199/: The poison doses requires to coat each 10 missiles, required 1 dose for the first 20 and an additional dose for each additional 10. This is bad math. It should be 1 dose per 10. Reported by Felius@Bay12.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/200/: Undefined 141 appeared in character abilities listing, this is because Master Artisan lacked an entry in the naming table.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/201/: The code which considers paralysis of a target as valid for coup de gras checked skills on the actor, rather than the victim.  Reported by Felius@Bay12, with handy save file.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/202/: The attribute rolling animation took a strangely long time.  The animation display update, and display delay were the same, but just seemed more effective (and slower) under libtcod.  This is fixed by only updating the animation for the first 0.5 seconds of the roll, as it's all a super fast graphical affectation anyway.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y14: 2014-11-15
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/129/: Journal entries are now listed in order of most recent to oldest.  Level stats are put first, instead of last.  This is to put the most relevant information in the most accessible place.  Reported by golgepapaz, with patch.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/135/: Lost symbols for wrapped messages.  This was observable through looking at monsters with lifesight cast.  Any wrapped text in the generated description would be overwritten in some cases.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/150/: Making a chi strike did not explicitly take mana from the victim, and likely took it from the actor.  Reported by dck k.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/155/: Gauntlets of Rust can be activated from the 'a'ctivate menu.  The description only addressed protection from rust, and not the 3x per day rusting grasp they can be used for.  The description has been amended.  Reported by dck k.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/167/: More level generation fixes related to room weights.  If comparing a signed value stored in an unsigned variable, cast it before comparison, not after.  Also, if all room types were flagged as already used, they would then all be unflagged for reuse - however it was also necessary to reset the room weights and more.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/173/: Knowledge domain does not grant scribe scroll spell as described.  Reported by Brett Olsen, with patch.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/176/: Compilation warning fixes broke alignment checks, resulting in penalties and restrictions for the wrong alignments.  Reported by John Olender, with patch.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/177/: Use menu was enacting the wrong effect, for selected innate abilities.  This was due to Y12 compiler warning fixes, where an argument to UseAbility was cast to uint8, and UseAbility had it typed as int16.  Reported by S M.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y13: 2014-10-27 UNSTABLE
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/167/: Sometimes when level areas are being generated, the selection of room types failed, and a fatal error put allowed the player to win the game of failed level area generation.  This game is not about the player winning, so the relevant code has been altered to better handle problem situations.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/168/: The tabbing between links in the help system causes crashes.  Legacy bug where code was looking for information using X as Y coordinate and Y as X coordinate.  Also a Y1 bug where looking up the character at a screen coordinate was incorrectly implemented.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/169/: This fixes the dialog which appears in debug builds when leaked stati backrefs are found.  When an object is removed, it cleans up the stati which have it as a target.  To do this, it looks at the backref on itself, then to the stati on the originating object.  But certain kinds of stati when removed, are simply orphaned with the backref removed explicitly.  The only problem was that the backref removal passed in opposite values than which it needed to, failing to remove the backref.  Then the removed object would see the backref again when it moved on to it's next removal, and not be able to find the now-orphaned stati.  Cue dialog.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/170/: Little known fact that objects get more difficult to unlock the deeper into the dungeon you get.  If a locked object in your inventory is examined, this fact combined with items in your inventory not being in the dungeon, results in a crash.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/170/: A different issue relates to broken dungeon generation, which places stairs down to unsafe terrain.  Fixing that would fix the dungeon generation.  This issue and fix relates to instead adding a confirmation dialog to the taking of stairs down to unsafe terrain, under the provisio you should be able to step down carefully and choose to step back up.  There is a school of thought that these stairs to unsafe terrain are an interesting feature which should be retained, regardless of fixes to dungeon generation.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y12: 2014-06-28 UNSTABLE
* This release is an interim one.  Hundreds of compiler warnings were fixed, and while most were benign explicit type casting, three were bugs.  Do not ask me what they were, as I was too stupid to note them down, and they are hidden amongst all the others.  These changes are possibly unstable, and might cause this release to be unreliable.
* I recreated the missing accent compiler compiler source code.  This allows changes to the IncursionScript language.
* Added typing support to the IncursionScript grammar for things like int8, int16 and so forth.  Previously all data typing was int32.  This was primarily to remove the warnings when compiling the generated IncursionScript engine to game engine method and function call access API code.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y11: 2014-06-10
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/140/: Fix bug where previous fix for scrolling position persisting in different windows that allow scrolling, broke scrolling in other locations.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/142/: Fixed a crash bug where when a monster would look for nearby items to pick up, and the variable that pointed to that object was not set.  Reported by Charlie G.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/146/: Fixed a bug where the error box would appear when a summoning creature reached it's time to go away, if it had items which were summoned with it.  A confluence of events would mean when an item was garbage collected, it would not find the back reference..  see the issue and linked changeset there-in for a detailed breakdown.   Reported by Hamel@Bay12.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/148/: Lockup bug.  More than 255 stati in place on an object would cause a inner stati tracking loop to overflow it's index wrapping it back to 0 before it could hit the exit clause.  Reported by Hamel@Bay12.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y10: 2014-06-01
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/11/: Fix spelling mistakes ('breech'->'breach', 'percieve'->'perceive', 'inherant'->'inherent').
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/19/: In system options menu, when switching to the 'macro bindings' page, the options description was leaked from the previous page.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/27/: Fix crash bugs which happen when dipping an item into a fountain.  The first case was where the dipped item transforms into a hostile monster at the location of the target of the dipping action, only dipping actions do not have a target but rather a first item (the dipped item) and a second item (the fountain).  The second case was where the item gets teleported somewhere on the map - only the map is larger than the bounds of the Roll() function, so a bounds error would be hit.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/106/: Fix a bug where potion of mending could be applied to anything regardless of that anything being a valid target.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/106/: Fix a bug where trying to apply something to an inventory items would crash when there were no items suitable to apply it to.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/111/: If you summon a phantom steed and it does not like you, it would go away.  But the message to tell you that, was muted because of a previous message output muting in the spell script which hadn't been correspondingly unmuted in this case.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/125/: The scroll position is now cleared when the scroll area is cleared, which means that where things are scrolled to is no long
er the same even if something different was displayed in the scroll area. Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/131/: The Lifesight priest spell affects natural living creatures, otherwise known codewise as MA_NLIVING.  There was no type name defined for this value, so when looked up it would print as 'Undefined 91'.  Now it is mapped to 'Natural Living Creature'.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/133/: The Forestation druid spell changes the terrain type, but turned allies hostile.  This is a general reaction that happens to friendlies who are affected by an effect with EP_CURSE purpose.  Forestation now has an additional purpose of EP_FIX_TROUBLE which ensures allies do not become hostile when affected by this.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/137/: Add libtcod credit animation to the startup screen.  Add some donation text to accompany it.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/138/: 'Change terrain type' in wizard menu implemented, replacing stub implementation which just put a 'wall of flame' tile down.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/139/: When the god Semirath gets angry, he tries to move things to random map locations, but causes a crash instead.  This is another case of bounds being exceeded, and crashing ensuing.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y9: 2014-05-08
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/126/: Google Breakpad caused crashes.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y8: 2014-05-06
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/91/: When an object was removed (and deleted), it would remove all fields (e.g. modify objects within range) it had created which moved with it.  This would leak the non-moving fields, which would get removed later with a hack, but because the creating object no longer existed the effects of the field could not be unapplied so it didn't bother.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/94/: Creatures who see their friends get killed could have gotten afraid.  Now mindless creatures in general are excluded from this.  Reported by Joseph Kerr.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/96/: Made 'Augment Summoning' an official metamagic feat. Note that if the only metamagic you have is this one, the spell manager will simply say 'Au[g]ment Spell' in the metamagic listing; this is not a compound noun, but a verb phrase.  Players are expected to be able to reconcile this to their 'Augment Summoning' feat.  View the line with multiple metamagic feats, to see the pattern.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/97/: Refreshing the spell manager rebuilt the feat list, which added onto the last time it was rebuilt, showing a more extended mangled doubled list each refresh.  Reported by Karagy.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/104/: It is no longer possible to mount something which is asleep.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/109/: Prevent mounting on a tile where it would not be possible to move to when mounted anyway.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/110/: Logic in the encounter generation badly checked if there was an actor involved.  I do not understand this game system, but this code is obviously bad.  Reported by Frumple. 
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/116/: Using static variables for inventory enumeration state means that if the logic in the loop which is enumerating the inventory calls something which in turn reenumerates the inventory before returning, then the inventory enumeration state will be at it's end and the loop will prematurely exit.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/117/: Could not use the escape key to exit the y key use menu.  The code supported handling an escape press already, but the flag to pay attention to escape at a lower level was not passed.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/119/: Trying to talk to something that was not a creature, or could not talk, would tell you they couldn't talk.  Unless they were a creature who could not talk, where you could order them if they were friendly to you.  Or if they were not a creature, when it went to see if they were friendly, it would just crash.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/123/: Bad code prevented the faster than the eye feat from allowing a player to put an item in a container and have it take no time.
* Turned on compilation warnings and found truncated values which would affect things like alignment changing when eating appropriate food, greeting people and encounter generation in unknown ways I have not bothered to identify.
* Fixed a crash where writing text left the cursor off the side of the screen, and the next time it blinked libtcod moaned about things being out of bounds.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y7: 2014-04-22
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/33/: Fixed error message encountered when either creating a character, or reincarnating it, depending on whether 'Flooded Cavern' region is placed in the generated dungeon.  This region had 'aboleth, with slaves' defined as a possible encounter, but sadly we have no aboleth (with or without slaves).  Reported by holsety_s, but let's be honest we were all getting it and ignoring it.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/58/: Attacking a door would calculate final damage before applying material hardness bonuses (i.e. wizlock).  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/62/: If one weapon was ranged, all weapons would get the ranged tag in their description.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/65/: Mobile fields from spells which were cancellable, could not be cancelled.  Mobile fields from spells could be stacked ad infinitum, now they are hard coded as non-stackable.  As each day passes, persistent effects should have been discarded, but a bug was modifying their duration and corrupted their identification as persistent.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/67/: Moving while up a tree no longer has a chance of falling if the creature has the brachiation feat.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/71/: Creatures attempting to move within a bad field (like a summoned swarm) would be unable to.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/76/: Replace spell list for 'Shadow Magic' which had same list as 'Phantasmal Force', with Evocation spells as described.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/85/: Fix a bug where if a creature had an innate ability and they rested, it would infinite loop trying to repeatedly remove it and failing because it shouldn't.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/86/: Added 'Heightened Senses' to the 'Mortal Coil' spellbook.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/88/: Change 'Chameleon Shifting' from an INFLICT (which has saving throws) to a GRANT (which has none).  Specify the hide skill bonus should be +10, not unspecified which is a +0.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/90/: Fixed crash where attacker standing on magma dies from magma damage incurred by attack/strike action, before actual strike action starts.  Reported by Frumple.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/93/: Ordering one summoned ally to return to their home plane resulted in all summoned allies returning to their home plane.
* Slipping on a pool of grease would incur some damage, and give a message that the acting entity fell.  However, whatever action was in progress would be allowed to proceed.  Now the action is aborted, in line with the acting entity falling over (and consistent with other slipping types).
* Pressing escape in character creation when selecting gender would cause a crash when the character was later reincarnated.  Now it is harmless.
* Using English instead of American spelling, because if they speak in English accents in Game of Thrones, it's how they must do it in all fantasy worlds.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y6: 2014-04-15
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/43/: In past libtcod builds at least, when the game was waiting for input, the CPU would be at full usage.  Now, the idle input loop only checks for input when it has to.  From 100% to 2% CPU usage.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/48/: The cursor blinking support was not implemented for libtcod.  Now it is, and the wonderous thing that it is can be viewed at various places like where you choose your gender in character creation.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/26/: Fix crash where missiles land on terrain where they cannot be placed (e.g. magma, slime, deep water) and it was assumed they were placed successfully, and subsequent logic failed.  Reported with reproduction data by Frumple from Bay12 forums.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/49/: Fix crash where monster moves over chasm or similar terrain where they fall, then die through damage acquired in doing so.  The logic did not check that the falling damage had killed the monster, and the logic crashed as a result.  Reported with reproduction data by Frumple from Bay12 forums.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/51/: Fix use of control and alt in UI like the inventory.  The fixes for non-US keyboards broke this use case by accident.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/54/: Casting a spell at a deep water tile was treated as casting a spell when standing on a deep water tile.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/52/: Chests were not autolootable, because chests are a type of container, but chests are not specifically containers.  The scripting language only recognised containers as containers.  Now, anything checked to be a container, will be considered a container even if it is a chest.  This may introduce problems where only specifically containers are intended to be included, and now chests are also.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y5: 2014-04-10
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/41/: Fix bug where numpad '.' key does not do rest action like normal '.' key.  This is because numpad is only supported when numlock is turned off, due to how we receive notification about key events from SDL2 via libtcod.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/42/: Fix bug where space key sends two key presses for each actual press.  This was caused by the non-US keyboard fix.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y4: 2014-04-09
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/39/typo-in-cant-rest-at-the-inn-anymore: Fix typo in cave entrance scripts, reported by Tuyen Tran.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/37/whips-unable-to-prevent-enemies-from: Fix bug where whips are unable to prevent enemies closing in with their reach, reported by Cranky_Corvids, fix provided by Carl Minden.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/38/monsters-picking-up-cursed-items-uncurse: Fix bug where when monsters died, they dropped their inventory.  But rather than clearing the flag on the item which marked the item as their property (and not something they could be ordered to give to the orderer), they cleared every other flag including as noted here the cursed flag.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/28/problems-with-knock-and-auto-knock: Extended knock spell description to refer to locked containers in general, and not just doors.
* Fix for resolution changing (via the options menu), and switching between full screen and windows (alt+enter).
* Preliminary fix for bug with some keyboards where people using non-US keyboard layouts find keys do not work as expected.  Please give feedback if this does not work for you, and how it is not working.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y3: 2014-04-05
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/32/oil-of-transformation-multiplies-stackable: Fix bug where when items change their type, perhaps from a rod to a staff, they get multiplied in quantity.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/35/skill-typos: Spelling fixes in skill descriptions.
* https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/34/capital-letters-not-working-shift-letter: Fix shifted keys and various other keys not working.  Not guaranteed to be correct, but is better than before.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y2: 2014-03-28
* Fix bug where saved games were not found, as the old Allegro pattern with two asterisks failed because libtcod file name matching only handles one asterisk.

Incursion (open source) 0.6.9Y1: 2014-03-25
* First release of the updated open source code.
* Replaced the dated Allegro 2.x as the base framework, with libtcod and it's underlying SDL2.

Incursion 0.6.9I
* Fixed bug with Maeve starting (very!) angry at elves
  who _do_ worship her.
* Fixed very low sac values for cloaks, etc. to Maeve;
  tweaked item costs a bit in general.
* Multitude domains fixed -- now truly random; manual
  updated on this issue to be correct.
* The "OOD removal loop" no longer runs if the game is
  set on NIGHTMARE difficulty.
* Fixed typo that broke a special case rule allowing
  dwarves to ride Medium mounts like warponies.
* Fixed error related to spitting spiders hitting
  objects with their spit attack.
* Fixed error with favor chart being truncated at
  level 7 because I forgot that the constant lists
  reserve 3 spots for null terminators (XavPieryLev.sav)
* Fixed text corruption with plural grammer (merge/merges)
  as seen in Grognard.sav
* Fixed favor overflow resulting from use of int16 where
  int32 should have been used. (Note: this broke save
  compatability).
* Fixed recursivee CalcVales stack overflow error
  (Kierny), and I _hope_ I didn't break anything else
  doing so.
* Fixed Khasrach's orc summons arriving with 0 hp (and
  assorted other "not initialized" problems, like no
  active buffs for the shamans).
* Fixed incredibly baroque bug which caused displeasure
  to be listed on character sheet as anger instead at
  some times.
* Fixed bug where displeased gods could still give
  interventions, and some other logic errors regarding
  intervention.
* Monster Summoning now excludes animals, undead,
  outsiders and incorporeal creatures.
* Fixed issue where Holy Summoning failed a lot for
  CN or CE clerics of gods other than Xel, Zurvash and
  Multitude. (It was trying to summon CN outsiders,
  most of which start at CR 7! Now it summons demons
  instead.) 

Incursion 0.6.9H (subrelease 4)
* Fixed a problem where illusory creatures were always
  CR 0, instead of CR based on Illusioncraft level.
* Fixed Kysul's "cannot descend" bug for real this time!
* Fixed Immotian's magic resistance (now 25% at favor
    level 7, +15% per favor level thereafter).

Incursion 0.6.9H (subrelease 3)
* Fixed the creature-calling aspect of illusion spells,
  which had been broken by the new encounter gen.
* Illusionists now start with scrolls of the higher
  level illusion spells, to help them survive the
  illusion-immune creatures at the beginning of the
  game.
* Fixed a bug with Kysul preventing people from
  descending even when not angry.
* Fixed bugs with the Master Archer's prerequisites.
* Fixed bug with Death Attack being applied against
  inanimate objects.
* Fixed "Strange Spell Type" Alienist bug.
* I _think_ I fixed the problem with researching curses
  using Knowledge (Magic). If not, I haven't a clue.

Incursion 0.6.9H (subrelease 2)
* Fixed bug with Maeve starting (very!) angry at elves
  who _do_ worship her.
* Fixed very low sac values for cloaks, etc. to Maeve;
  tweaked item costs a bit in general.
* Multitude domains fixed -- now truly random; manual
  updated on this issue to be correct.
* The "OOD removal loop" no longer runs if the game is
  set on NIGHTMARE difficulty.
* Fixed typo that broke a special case rule allowing
  dwarves to ride Medium mounts like warponies.
* Fixed error related to spitting spiders hitting 
  objects with their spit attack.
* Fixed error with favor chart being truncated at
  level 7 because I forgot that the constant lists
  reserve 3 spots for null terminators (XavPieryLev.sav)
* Fixed text corruption with plural grammer (merge/merges)
  as seen in Grognard.sav
* Fixed favor overflow resulting from use of int16 where
  int32 should have been used. (Note: this broke save
  compatability).
* Fixed recursivee CalcVales stack overflow error
  (Kierny), and I _hope_ I didn't break anything else
  doing so.
* Fixed Khasrach's orc summons arriving with 0 hp (and
  assorted other "not initialized" problems, like no
  active buffs for the shamans).
* Fixed incredibly baroque bug which caused displeasure
  to be listed on character sheet as anger instead at
  some times.
* Fixed bug where displeased gods could still give
  interventions, and some other logic errors regarding
  intervention.
* Monster Summoning now excludes animals, undead,
  outsiders and incorporeal creatures.
* Fixed issue where Holy Summoning failed a lot for
  CN or CE clerics of gods other than Xel, Zurvash and
  Multitude. (It was trying to summon CN outsiders,
  most of which start at CR 7! Now it summons demons
  instead.)

Incursion 0.6.9H
* Fixed horrid bug in Magic::Dispel, that sometimes
  caused dispel effects to remove critical stati like
  HUNGER or ALIGNMENT. This might also be the fix for
  the elusive "spell access loss" bug.
* Added fix to prevent divide by zero crash when 
  leaving an area related to Thief in the Night.
* Fixed bug with disease damage occuring too frequently
  for diseases with iteration > 100.
* For the sake of player sanity, monsters now never
  cast Black Tentacles, Shatter, Adamant Facade, Create 
  Water, Deeper Darkness and Whirlpool.
* Monster are no longer generated for summoning circles
  until the dungeon gen is smart enough to have the
  circles properly warded.
* Gravestone monsters are now less tough.
* Gravestones are now only disturbed by actions taken
  by the player character, until the monster AI is
  smart enough to not disturb them except when it
  makes sense to do so.
* Class templates can now only be applied to monsters
    who are humanoid with Int >= 7 -- no more arctic
    boar mages or shocker lizard paladins!
* Fixed horrible bug with the script compiler that
  caused it to create files with a backslash in their
  filenames under Ubuntu, even on NTFS partitions where
  it then caused disk errors in Windows! Eeew! 
* Commented Accursed Cows out of the game entirely, since I
  can't easily exclude them from summons with single-point
  source changes. Ditto foxbats.
* Commented out /Verdant Aid/ awaiting brainstorming on a
  decent way to fix it.
* Summoned creatures cannot multiply.
* Commented out ID Moss until it's growth, and growth of
  hit points, can be debugged properly.
* As a temporary fix against deep dungeon monster glut,
  whenever a single encounter generates more than five
  monsters, only the first five are created and placed on
  the map; any remaining are dropped.
* Added a quick loop to automatically delete any overly OOD
  monster on the level after it is first generated, and also
  after monsters regen when the player sleeps. If OOD switch
  is on, any monster with CR > [Depth + 3] is deleted, else
  any monster with CR > [Depth + 1] is deleted. Monsters in
  the goblin camp are never deleted for this reason.
* Complex rooms (magic academy, etc.) now generate numerically
  less monsters -- either only 1 monster per room, or only 1
  in 3 rooms will have a group of monsters, the rest being
  totally empty.
* Asherath now only says "you feel challenged" when you kill a
  creature whose CR is higher than yours.
* Maeve now steals cloaks, amulets and rings properly.
* Maeve now only polymorphs followers into humanoid forms that
  have hands and are not inherantly blind.
* Maeve now accepts the sacrifice of charismatic creatures
  correctly.
* Doubled the favor value of cloaks, rings and such sacrificed
  to Maeve. Ditto books and wands to Immotian.
* Fixed crash bug where Maeve's intervention to improve magic
  items would hang the game.
* Maeve now improves magic items more substantially for those
  with lots of favor with her.
* Mara's helpful summons should no longer arrive angry!
* Major fix with regard to god tolerance for transgressions,
  described below.
* All gods' TOLERANCE_VAL increased by 3 (so you can get 3 more
  'anger points' before the god is considered truly 'angry').
* Mara's revenant aid no longer crashes the game.
* Fixed god-granted Improved Crit
* Essiah now grants full Free Action rather than simply immunity
  to paralysis.
* Fixed Aiswin's higher-level innate spell grants.
* Mara's script code now handles the sacrifice of corpses
  correctly, I hope.
* Sacrificing things now lowers a god's anger much more quickly,
  taking off 3 anger points instead of just 1.
* Barbarians and orcs are now exempt from the Cow restriction
  for chaotic characters.
* Characters can now hopefully gain favor levels from multiple
  gods as lay worshippers correctly.

  Divine transgression works a little differently now. Your god
gets displeased on the first transgression, and angry when you
cross over his tolerance value for transgressions. So, for
example, a follower of Khasrach will have a chance to placate
her with corpses after a fear trap rather than her getting
angry right away. The character sheet should list whether your
god is angry or displeased.
  A displeased god will still aid you when you pray, and won't
do wrathful things, but will not send favorable interventions,
and sacrifices will be used to amerlorate the displeasure as
opposed to granting more favor.
  Let me know if this seems buggy -- I haven't had time to test
it very fully.

Incursion 0.6.9A
* Fixed incorrect calculation of percentile value mods
    from templates (that caused, for example, human
    zombies to have 100% movement rate rather than 30%).
* Added trap message for "alignment loss" bug.
* Assassins now have Alchemy, so they can make custom
    poisons with Poison Use.
* Fixed crash bug when generating encounter summons where
    there was no in-game summoner creature (i.e.,
    Multitude wrath, Kissi.sav).
* Fixed issue with summoning preset monsters (i.e., dust
    devil) over water trying to make the encounter be
    aquatic and ending up generating strange random
    summons.

Incursion 0.6.9
* Implemented better auto-testing for reproducing crash
    bugs.
* Fixed a bug in the script engine likely responsible
    for diverse crashes, including Semirath intervention.
* Fixed crash bug on summoning related to missing zero
    terminators on the CandidateCreatures array.
* Fixed crash bug relating to division by zero when
    calculating knockback for airborne creatures.
* Fixed a crash relating to overflowing string buffers
    in the monster AI.
* Fixed crash bug related to unll map pointers when the
    Intimidate abilities kick in.
* Fixed crash-causing infinite loop related to attempts
    (by monster or PC) to break grapples.
* Fixed crash bug relating to newly-introduced "snow
    angel" monster.
* Fixed crash bug from VERIFY macro in CallMemberFunc()
* Fixed Creature::GetBAB-centric error messages.
* GetBAB now reports the correct BAB for monsters with
    BAB-increasing templates.
* Reduced creation of "castle" multi-rooms by 50%, by
    request of testers for balance.
* Fixed infinite-loop crash/hang bug in encounter gen
    involving nested encounters
* Fixed crash issues with Animate Objects, and added
    code to handle it better if this spell fails for
    some reason.
* Fixed crash bug with NULL map pointers and the print
    queue after attacks.
* Implemented compressed save files. This should both
    save disk space and make AutoSave less tedious at
    lower dungeon levels.
* (Intentionally) OOD encounters now generate only a
    single OOD monster, rather than potentially an
    entire party of them. Big fix!
* When OOD monsters are created, they are now logged
    in the player's journal for debugging purposes.
    Same for other eccentric encounter gen behaviour.
    This will go away when I get things better fine-
    tuned. "Failed" messages are not necessarily
    errors; the encounter gen sometimes fails and
    tries something different naturally.
* Fixed crash bug when corpses were destroyed; it was
    related to backRefs and code included to prevent
    Animated Objects from causing crashes.
* Put in placeholders for the new prestige classes.
* Fixed a problem causing priests to cast overly high
    level spells at a low dungeon level (because they
    had a template intended for high-CR, high-HD 
    giant priests).
* Added new skill templates: master, paragon and
    legendary, to allow more powerful adventurers in
    challenge mode.
* Fixed div-by-zero crash bug in mana regeneration
    calculation.
* Fixed crash bug where moving into/out of a field
    causes the death of the mobile creature, resulting
    in a map null pointer reference.
* Fixed crash bug with missiles being destroyed or
    taken off-map while in flight.
* Fixed glitch where the encounter "graveborn creatures"
    would sometimes produce adult dragons at very low
    CRs. (I believe this was the cause of "mages" that
    cast cleric spells at low dungeon levels -- they
    were polymorphed dragons.)
* The encounter gen now keeps lowering the max base CR
    on consecutive tries to make room for manditory
    templates, so that they (hopefully) won't get skipped
    anymore.
* Encounters created in fiery or icy prisons now appear
    inside the prison area properly.
* Tested AutoRun ('run to location'), seems to work great
    for me. I need some 0.6.9 saves duplicating the issues
    people have with this! 
* Immotian, the Multitude, Maeve, etc. now place their summons
    near the player correctly.
* Lots of general tweaking and fine-tuning to match special
    room types with thematic encounters.
* Flaming sphere, dust devil, spiritual hammer and summon
    shadows now cannot be used again while the first summons
    is still present. SS has higher CR, but costs fatigue.
    These construst spells do not count towards you 'max
    creatures controlled' PHD.
* Summoned creatures and illusions can no longer be live-
    sacced.
* The Multitude now has a stricture against magical healing,
    since they were a little to easy to accomidate before.
* The center square of tanglefoot bag strands and web
    spells now disappears properly. (The cause was writing
    the center twice, and thus recording the written terrain
    from the first write as the 'terrain to restore' on the
    second.)
* Aiswin no longer expects you to get revenge on traps that
    critically wound you, or on dieties expressing their
    wrath upon you.
* Holy Avengers now grant 50% magic resistance.
* Added a switch allowing the player to control the use of
    the Dirty Fighting feat, for the sake of alignment.
    Lawful NPCs don't use it, either.
* New monsters: batkin, gremlin, githzerai, githyanki (and
    added "silver sword" unique weapon and new psi powers
    to support the gith races), senmurv, lillend, feyr.
* Fixed crash bug with NULL EActor in Creature::Death, that
    triggered when monsters petrify.

Incursion 0.6.8A
* New monsters: ankheg, allip, dryad, aboleth, skum,
  wyste, snow angel, 3 cave dinosaurs.
* Fixed issues with Intensive Study feat and empty
    selection menu (Uchie.sav)
* Fixed armor of etherealness fatigue cost.
* Fixed "lose favor on sacrifice" bug.
* Fixed crash bug with Circle Kick feat.
* Shields now quick-intuit just like weapons/armor. 
* All sacred mounts are now rideable.
* Clarified mount logic a bit -- dwarves can now
  ride either Medium or Large mounts, and only
  kobolds can ride vermin (unless the vermin are
  spiders, in which case drow can ride them too.)
  Also, only quadrupeds (rather than all animals)
  are limited by /maximum size/ as mounts.
* Number of creatures in a single encounter is now
  capped at 5/7/10/12/15 at levels 1/2/3/4/5 to
  avoid overpowering swarms.
* Fixed "This cave orc must be something!" style
  messages, and general tweaks to avoid a monster
  being scrutinized prematurely.
* Expert Tactician now only grants one attack per
  victim per turn for free -- still a good feat,
  but not instant death when the requirements are
  met.
* Fixed bug causing Cleave attacks to always hit.
* Now weapons that return as part of their mundane
  nature (chakram, boomerang) only return on a hit.
  Weapons with the magical "returning" quality
  always return, hit or miss.
* Temporarily removed the priest spell "Imbue With
  Spell Ability" as a step toward tracking down
  the SPELL_ACCESS bug; I don't think it worked
  correctly anyway. Will put it back soon!

Incursion 0.6.8
* Complete refactoring of the Encounter Gen system
  to remove multiple persistant bugs and implement
  the use of Encounter resources for more diverse
  and thematically grouped encounters.
* Wrote core set of Encounter resources.
* Added groundwork for Behaviour resources and rule-
  based monster AI; no game-affecting changes have
  actually been made yet.
* New monsters: cave pelican, chinook salmon, 
  cavefish, pirahna, tabaxi, oxthixi.
* Fixed (some) false-positives on SPELL_ACCESS stati
  error message.

Incursion 0.6.5B
* Warriors now get a starting weapon with _minimum_
  +1 (or +2 if no elemental quality) rather than
  set, so the code won't reduce the plus level of
  starting perks.
* The resource compiler now works correctly under
  Linux as well as Win32.
* Linux build process successfully streamlined.
* Can now issue orders to all followers within line
  of sight with a single command.
* Added new order, Do Not Pick Up Items.
* Fixed bug where cave orcs have /animate rope/ as
  an innate spell (which I put in to test the animated
  rope crashed and forgot to remove!)
* Fixed broken parts of /abjure/, where non-summoned
  creatures weren't immune and you could kill yourself
  with it.

Incursion 0.6.5A
* Fixed horrid multi-faced bug in monster AI with an
  array overwrite that caused the game to crash if a
  monster stepped on a stack of 60+ items, or had more
  than 64 possible actions in general (Adele Detect
  Monster save).
* Fixed bug causing crash if you leave goblin camp with
  lots of monsters never having seen you in the Thief
  in the Night calculations due to array overflow.
* Remembered to build the release-configuration EXE
  this time!

Incursion 0.6.5
* Identify spell now takes 1 hour and costs 2 fatigue.
* Fixed glitch allowing the casting of Glyph of
  Warding and similar spells across walls via Wizard
  Sight (but you can still cast physical spells like
  fireball into non-LOS areas).
* Added weaknesses to flight and levitation -- Balance
  check needed for spellcasting, knockback when hit.
* Fixed bug where trying to remove certain cursed items
  negated the curse effect.
* Fixed bug where when an item becomes cursed, the
  curse effects aren't applied until you re-wield it.
* Apportation can no longer be used to remove cursed
  items.
* Tried to trace reported memory corruption relating to 
  ice blue eyes and/or their spell-likes, but didn't
  find anything.
* Corrected spell description for Open the Third Eye
  (no damage from gaze attack anymore).
* Gaze Reflection now protects against a bodak's death
  gaze and a nymph's unearthly beauty.
* Fixed glitch allowing spirit armor and normal armor
  to stack.
* Ekliazeh no longer angers if you kill construct, non-
  sapient or undead dwarves; Khasrach no longer angers 
  if you kill construct or non-sapient orcs and Kysul
  no longer angers if you kill construct aberrations.
  Immotian's fire creature restructions are unchanged --
  a clockwork fire creature is like a holy symbol to 
  him.
* Now, the weapon immunity special ability only affects
  actual, physical weapons -- unarmed attacks penetrate
  it automatically. The monk special ability "ki strike"
  was removed, since it no longer makes sense. This
  serves to balance magical armor with the Invulnerability
  and Great Invulnerability qualities, which were reduced
  slightly in plus.
* Fixed HORRID bug that prevented the dice roll for Quell
  from being made; it should now work properly.
* Fixed glitch causing orc paladins to start with a holy
  knife instead of a holy long sword.
* Rope Trick no longer preserves an altar (or other feature)
  created in the extra-dimensional space; it can also no
  longer be cast again when already in the extradimensional
  space.
* Gave animated rope a bunch of monster flags it was
  intended to have, so it won't, i.e., pick up and use
  equipment any more.
* Fixed bug where killing an animated rope reliably crashed
  the game. Refactored code for animated/transformed
  objects.
* Added "trap code" to try to track down the loss of spell
  access bug, that should (hopefully) cause a message to
  appear at the actual moment of loss (and then terminate
  the game, so that an intact save game can be recovered).
* Fixed one possible source of the "very high spell DC" bug,
  relating to lizardfolk and dwarves getting +2 DC with
  water and earth spells, and the variable that stores this
  not being cleared between DC calculation calls. Let me 
  know ASAP if you see crazy spell/special ability DCs in
  0.6.5 or above.
* Essiah's "betray a friend" condition no longer triggers
  if the "friend" has M_MINDLESS (i.e., animated rope).
* Boots of Phasing made very high level (14) until I can
  find a way to balance them properly -- now only high
  luck characters will find them on rare occasions.

Incursion 0.6.4E
* Fixed bug causing crashes upon reading scrolls
* Live sacrifices now working properly
* Fixed bug where everyone got Sabine's favor bonus
  for high athletic skills rather than just Sabine
  followers.

Incursion 0.6.4D
* Fixed (hopefully) sources of inexplicable crashes.
* Fixed bug with multiclass characters being unable to
  take prestige classes.
* Fixed bug with spells not recieving Wis bonus damage.
* Fixed Brand of Hatred.
* AutoSave crashes verified fixed.
* Fixed Log of Everburning

Incursion 0.6.4C
* Fixed crash bug when using a Holy Avenger against
  a flesh golem, and many other similar situations.
* Fixed a complex bug in the target system that would
  manifest, among other things, in failed Intimidate
  attempts causing crashes (Rathmere Xel sac save).

Incursion 0.6.4B
* Fixed issue with arcane alienist athiests needing a
  nonexistant holy symbol to cast alienist-specific
  spells.
* Added option to prevent ally/mount actions counting
  against alignment until ally-attacks-neutral can be
  solved more fully.
* Fixed issue with very low shop prices.
* Fixed RemoveStatiFrom(xID 0) crash (Kierny Tauth).

Incursion 0.6.4A
* Added fix to prevent monsters from trying again and
  again to wield an item when they fail (such as because
  it is too large, or whatever).
* Fixed the adlet frost weapon script so that it does
  not add duplicate stati for every wield attempt until
  the stati overflow, and so the stati are only added
  after the weapon is successfully wielded (cf. Cade
  Goodheart crash).
* Crash on Wildshape use (Diesa) fixed.
* Commented out code that causes sacrifices which do
  not impress a god not to reduce the god's anger --
  now, any acceptable sac will lower a god's anger.
  This is NOT a long term change, just a kludge to make
  the game more playable over the next four months until
  I balance the "impressed" requirements more carefully.
* Fixed bad logic in the "no talking through solid stone"
  code that prevented the store from working -- now
  special creatures that have not actually been placed on
  the map, like Roark Ironbeard, can be talked to
  correctly.
* Fixed crash related to armor with qualities (i.e., might)
  as a starting perk (or in general, really) getting its
  plus improved for starting as a warrior. You now also
  should get the bonus from these items.
* Girdle of Tenacity verified to work (for me).

Incursion 0.6.4
* Fixed bug where buying items in store put them silently
  in InAir slot, possibly overwriting previous purchase,
  and did not move correctly to inventory screen.
* Gave each god custom experience table based on the favor
  numbers that seem to actually appear in the game, looking
  at victory posts.
* Toned down Asherath's rate of favor gain for killing high
  CR creatures.
* Skeletal foot soldier CRs now more sensible, so avoid low
  level instakills.
* Drow given an absolute minimum depth of dlev 4, to avoid
  arbitrary sleep-poison related deaths, and because being
  a "deep" monster is thematic for them.
* Fixed (hopefully) situations where polymorph lasted more
  or less than 20 XP ticks as a result of polyTicks being
  reset incorrectly.
* Set polymorph expiry to not affect druidic wildshape, only
  the other sources of polymorph.
* Removed the "cannot cancel" clause from polymorph, to
  avoid some odd game-ending situations; instead attached a
  2 fatigue cost to prevent excessive 'form scumming'.
* Fixed/revised Master Trip feat into line with canon -- it
  now causes the *tripper* to *suffer* an AoO if he tries
  to trip *without* the feat. (Before, it was documented as
  giving the attacker an AoO on the victim, which I think
  may have been me coding a bug and Wes documenting it how
  he thought it was supposed to work. Or I was just confused.)
* Implemented Trip manuever clause where opponent gets free
  trip attempt against would-be tripper if initial trip 
  attempt fails. Ditto for disarm.
* Fixed maneuver check code in several ways; now uses BAB +
  Attr + modifiers, and displays calculation correctly.
* Reverted Slipaway feat to its old form of a bonus to the
  Escape Grapple maneuver check.
* Great Blow description and in-game mechanic now match --
  +2 flat bonus to hit and damage, and also Strength bonus
  to damage is doubled.
* Removed help-text reference to Disarm using parry bonus
  (which it doesn't, and hasn't for a while now).
* Tools (including bags, flasks), holy symbols and shields
  are now exempted from AutoPickup.
* Fixed bug causing crashes when resting in a Place of
  Sanctuary.
* A flaming sphere can now be used as a source of fire for
  the /pyrotechnics/ and /fire charm/ spells.
* Murgash and his viziers no longer flee as a result of
  natural HP loss in combat.
* Player-ally monsters no longer use A_ROAR or any variants,
  because they can't aim it right not to hit the player;
  this can be an issue with chasmes sent by the Multitude
  putting the PC to sleep with their droning in the middle
  of combat.
* You now get a warning message if you are about to zot
  neutral undead with Turn Undead and are (or want to be)
  good-aligned.
* Fixed "super 1 gp item" bug (by using floating point
  arithmetic! Ow!)
* Toned down Sunscorch by making it level 2 and taking
  away the bonus damage from wisdom.
* Altered /spirit armor/ to be incompatible with conventional
  armor the same way that /mage armor/ is.
* Elevation bonus to Defense is now [2 + (Climb / 6)], when
  it was [2 + (Climb / 3)] before.
* Casting a spell while mounted or climbing on the ceiling now
  takes 15 phases more than normal.
* Bracers of Defense toned down -- they now add their magical
  plus to defense and coverage, rather than twice their magical
  plus.
* Longstrider now specifically only applies to a chosen humanoid
  rather than the caster in general, so it will no longer affect
  an animal companion mount through the shared-spell bond.
* Summoning pseudonatural creatures now costs [Summon CR x 2]
  extra mana, and this mana does not regenerate.
* Implemented Elemental Affinity ability for dwarves and lizards.
* Replaced acid spells in slime domain with spells that can be 
  without offending Kysul.
* Vicious weapons now work as advertized, now dealing bonus
  damage only if you have 2/3rds or more your max HP.
* Fixed incorrent "avert your gaze" message when you are averting
  your eyes from a creatures with a gaze attack.
* Added clause to prevent Beast Claw from being used on a creature
  that already has a natural claw attack; also prevented every
  monster from casting it, to avoid excess uniformity.
* Hopefully fixed issue with Point Buy and Reincarnation.
* Reincarnation now also saves chargen options.
* Changing options from the main splash screen, when no character
  has been created, also now changes the universal defaults for
  the Tactical and CharGen options for every new character made.
  (i.e., Poisoned Missile Stacking will not 'reset' if set from
  the system menu).
* Added sub-headers to make the options setting process clearer.
* Fixed reincarnation issue which could cause the game to record
  rolling method incorrectly for reincarnated characters.
* Bug which caused the creation of two mismatching options files,
  one in "incursion/." and one in "incursion/save" fixed.
* Fixed loophole allowing jumping out of a pit.
* Fixed issue with not being able to attack aerial monsters who
  were standing over pits.
* Characters now recieve a Fort or Will save (depending on the
  effect) when moving over the endgame Guardian Runes.
* Hopefully fixed the issue with nymphs killing themselves with
  their own Unearthly Beauty.
* Removed references to "Greater Magic Fang", since "Magic Fang"
  covers in Incursion what GMF did in canon; Zurvash now grants
  Divine Agility at 8th favor level instead.
* You are no longer able to lose your backpack by stowing it in
  itself.
* When a container gets /detonate/ed, the contents now spill out
  rather than vanishing.
* Fixed issue with /dispel magic/ dispelling things it has no
  business dispelling, such as divine blessings and poisons.
* Creatures now return to their home plane immediately when they
  take off boots of phasing or armor of etherealness, avoiding
  spending the rest of the game stuck on the ethereal plane.
* Fixed a crash-to-desktop bug related to monsters with zero
  mana.
* Small paladins now start with a "small long sword" (a new weapon
  the size of a shortsword, but balanced for swinging and placed
  in the long blades group) rather than a short sword.
* Gnomes now only start with a mercurial broadsword if they have
  the required strength, which has been lowered; also, gnome
  rangers and warriors have free cranquin proficiency.
* Small characters start with a buckler in situations where other
  characters would start with a kite shield.
* You can no longer talk to creatures through walls unless you
  have telepathy with sufficient range.
* Fixed crash when attempting to grapple/sunder/etc. doors,
  items, etc.
* The "contaminated water" fountain effect now respects disease
  immunity.
* Implemented the use of [ALT] as a "qualifier key" to split a
  pile when using Get, Stow, Swap, Drop or Take Out.
* Should a creature with poison immunity become poisoned, they
  now become unpoisoned on their very next turn without any ill
  effects, as opposed to staying perpetually poisoned (as with
  the kobold drinking a potion of poison and being forevermore
  unable to rest due to being "too busy dying").
* Fixed loophole allowing player to kick a monster which had
  successfully charmed him.
* Implemented the feat, Lion Heart, to help fighter-types having
  trouble with fear effects.
* Telepathy now allows you to speak to sapient creatures you could
  not otherwise communicate with, such as myconids or elementals.
* Fixed loophole allowing Swap Weapons command to be used to get
  rid of cursed weapons.
* Added new anger clauses to Aiswin and Asherath to give them more
  depth and make them more balanced with the other gods.
* When choosing the weapon associated with a feat, weapons for which
  you lack the minimum strength now appear on the list, but will
  warn you of the lack before you choose them.
* Fixed the "Exotic Weapon Proficiency blocks Weapon Focus" bug,
  which was in fact a bug with SetEffStatiVal() that was likely
  responsible for a LOT of other issues.
* Fixed bug where characters don't start with the weapon they
  bought Weapon Focus in the way they should.
* Fixed incorrect code that might have been responsible for some
  cases of characters starting with duplicate items.
* Hopefully fixed issue with "(undefined 0)bane" weapons and
  "weapons of (undefined 0) Slaying" showing up for good.
* Items will no longer say {tried} when both their base effect
  and their curse state is known.
* Fixed nonsensical message about dungeon features disbelieving
  illusions.
* Implemented Elethiomel's "roll stats before race and class"
  request; now if you turn on the Roll Attributes First option,
  they will always be rolled before both race and class. You will
  see 3 perks, but only get 1 or 2 if you choose a race that only
  gets one or two.
* When a worn item changes plus, has its plus altered by a temporary
  magic effect (i.e., Greater Magic Weapon), is dispelled or soforth,
  the wearer's stats should now change automatically rather than the
  item needing to be removed and re-equipped for the change to take
  effect.
* Riders are now thrown from mounts when a size change makes the
  mount/rider combination invalid.  
* Reflective Counterspell should now only affect spells marked as
  curses or attacks.
* Fixed "Negative Dice Values" error when dipping items in fountains.
* Added a message upon [ESC] explaining to the player that they
  cannot quit inventory mode when the InAir slot is occupied.
* If the PC dies while performing actions in Inventory Mode, the
  game now handles it gracefully.
* You can now tab back to a chest or other container on the floor
  in inventory mode correctly.
* Hopefully fixed issue with hiding monsters making unfair attacks
  against players who are also hiding, when the monster is unable 
  to percieve the player.
* Maeve's interventions now train Luck.
* When Maeve summons twilight huntsmen to attack the player, they
  now always arrive hostile.
* Training Int and Wis is harder now.
* Divine ressurection now costs you 15% of your XP or 2000 XP,
  whichever is more; the old penalty (down to the amount needed
  for the level below your current level) was reported by a player
  as too harsh.
* Scrolls of damaging spells like Shout, and many similar items that
  do not have a magical plus but do have a caster level, now display
  their damage/power correctly in the item description.
* Fixed a bug where creatures with size fields could move over 
  neutral creatures like smaller creatures do, allowing the neutrals
  to overlap their size fields, which should never happen.
* Fixed a bug causing size fields to overwrite solid terrain like
  dungeon walls -- since the most normal case with a size field /
  wall glyph overlap is a large creature squeezing into a small
  space, the size glyph shouldn't be shown in a solid stone square.
* Meld into Stone now works properly when cast by a Huge or larger
  creature.
* The Examine command in the Look prompt no longer has the loophole
  to identify polymorphed monsters that you didn't see polymorph.
* Fixed a bug which allowed monsters to wield weapons which were
  too large (i.e., a halfling could wield a greataxe!).
* Added some god messages, so that hopefully players won't see the
  "(god messages still in progress)" thing so much anymore, though
  there's still a lot to do in that regard.
* Fixed crash issue in some situations when either monsters or the
  player attempted to escape a grapple.
* Fixed infinite recursion issue with ReApply().
* Fixed crash with red slaadi attempting to gate in help with an
  MType that didn't fit in int8.

Incursion 0.6.3
* Adjusted tumbling to give [(Tumble / 2) x 5] to movement
    rate rather than [Tumble x 5], which proved to be
    excessive.
* Corrected errors in Tumble skill description so that it
    matches game rules (i.e., can't cast while tumbling)
* Now, only 1 in 3 monsters will use /obscurement/, to 
    avoid it being this omnipresent out-of-genre tactic
    where every dragon is a mobile fog bank.
* Added new spell, /abjure/, to banish summoned creatures
    en masse.
* Fixed bug with messages associated with items in the
    inventory of a creature not being printed because the
    item had no map associated with it; the owner did.
* Added Precise Stroke combat option, giving creatures
    (both PC and monsters) the ability to sometimes hit
    enemies with extremely high Defense scores.
* Fixed issue where flying characters over pits could not
    attack or be attacked.
* Fixed Greater Ring of Identify uses per day decsription.
* Fixed "doesn't want to associate with good" message
    coming from inherantly good creatures like gold dragons
    instead of demons and such.
* Fixed issues with "Brand of Hatred". Ditto "Shillelagh".
* Fixed issue with the Pacify option of Animal Empathy
    being coded improperly and creating allied creatures
    that stopped being allied later, when it should really
    just create neutrals.
* Fixed issue with TargetMount being given to allies:
  /* VERY IMPORTANT CORRECTION -- add the mount target only if
      we are riding a creature that is neutral to us, so that
      we are its master for only so long as we ride it. Do NOT
      add the mount target to creatures who were are allies
      already before we rode them! */
  When something happened that caused a mount to turn hostile,
  this error made the mount stay friendly /until you dismounted/,
  because the mount data was corrupted by the fact that it had
  two target object for the PC -- TargetSummoner and TargetMount.
* Fixed major root of mount hostility -- when you cast a spell,
  your sacred mount gets affected through the bond, thinks you
  cast a hostile spell at it and gets angry -- because all the
  personal effect spells aren't marked EF_NOTBAD.
  Now, spells channeled through the sacred mount spell-link will
  never turn a mount hostile, and also spells that are not EP_CURSE
  or EP_ATTACK will never turn _any ally_ hostile. There are some
  holes in this -- there are offensive spells that will kill but
  are not EP_ATTACK because the monster AI does not know how to
  use them, for example, and you can kill your mount if you have
  more HP by casting attack spells at yourself. But I think that
  the player being able to game the system to kill their pets 
  without consequences is not a huge weakness right now.
* Fixed a bug where lots of messages concerning mounts (i.e.,
  "snaps and turns on you", but lots of others too) would not
  be printed because the mount isn't technically on the map.
* Fixed a bug with monsters that have M_HOSTILE like griffons
  letting that override having a master/rider.
* Added new event handlers to handle what happens when you Quell, 
  Cow or Surrender to Goblin King.
* Increased the DC of Quell checks slightly [15 + CR*3], when
  it was [15 + CR*2]. You need to be a real high-end Diplomacy
  monkey to win the game that way.
* Added a kludge to deal with you doing social actions on the
  members of the Goblin Army that would affect Murgash -- they
  either redirect the effect to Murgash himself (for surrender)
  or tell you to talk to the king.
  Being unable to Quell the goblin army outer members may be
  difficult for Hesani followers, but I think their best approach
  is to sneak in using Hide, invisibility, etherealness, etc. so
  they can speak to the king directly.
* Fixed a crash-bug related to Immotian's observation of the 
  world.
* You can now order allies or request neutrals attack a specific
  target of your choice, and it works. This was there before, but
  it was generally wonky and is now fixed.
* Fixed horrid memory-corruption bug in endgame caused by the game
  trying to give goblins the PC prestige class "shadowdancer" as
  opposed to the monster template "shadowdancer;template".
  
The "Explore Mode" Features:
* Explore Mode implemented. Game enters explore mode when any
    explore options are set or when perks are rerolled.
* Chargen options now listed on character sheet.
* Number of rerolls and number of deaths now recorded on
    character sheet.
* Character generation options now can be changed in Wizard Mode
  even in gameplay.
* Elude Death switch implemented.
* Power Stats switch implemented.
* Difficulty Level switch implemented.
* Player can now abort to rolling without perks or point buy
    from the 4d6+Perks stat system, or to point buy from 4d6.
* Removed some broken abilities from the perk possible special
    abilities lists.
* Removed armor proficiencies from the perk possible feats.
    
The "Infinite Safe Rest Fix":
* The inn above the dungeon is no longer available for safe
  rest once the player reaches dungeon level 4 or character
  level 5.
* Resting in the Rope Trick dimension now costs 150 XP per
  night.
* You can now only rest [2 + Luck bonus] times safety in a
  Place of Sanctuary before that given Place is worn out.
  Those with a high degree of favor with Essiah can make
  use of these places once more for every three permanent
  blessings from the goddess.

The "Self-Buffing Caster Fix":
* Haste now gives a 50% bonus to Spd and Mov rather
    than 100%.
* Shield gives +5 Def rather than +7.
* Creatures now lose their weapon, insight and dodge
    bonuses to Def during the Timeout after casting
    a spell. They also have a general -4 penalty,
    reduced to -2 if they have Combat Casting.
* Implemented Mana Bleed
* Decastave now has a speed modifier of 125% rather
    than 200%.
* Characters now suffer a -(40 - [Ride x 2])% circumstance
    penalty to spell success rates when attempting to cast
    spells while mounted.
* A natural 20 attack roll now ignores miss chance from
    spells like /blur/, /displacement/ or /blink/.
* The /fly/ spell is no longer compatible with mounts -- it
    dismounts you when cast and self-cancels when you try
    to mount anything.
* Polymorph effects are now limited to a creature of 1/2 the
    target's CR rather than the full target's CR.
* Invisibility is now cancelled by casting attack, curse or
    summoning spells, or other spells targeting hostiles. You
    can still cast things like /true strike/, however.
* Creatures of CR 5+ now have a chance to spot the "ripple
    effect" of an invisible creature.
* Added new magical item: Wand of Dispelling
* Added new endgame guardian runes effect: dispel magic
* Added code to cause monsters to use /dispel magic/
    strategically based on the level of damage in can
    inflict to a given target.
* Created new flag to give to certain spells to make monsters
    four times more likely to use that specific spell if they
    have access to it, and gave that flag to /fireball/, /magic
    missile/, /lightning bolt/, /ice storm/, /cone of cold/ and
    /flame strike/.
* Made the Dispelling Trap three times more common in the dungeon.
* Gaze attacks now cost non-regenerating mana and can be turned
    off using a tactical switch.
* The three-eyed template has been toned down so that it only
    grants +30 feet infravision and a confusion gaze, rather than
    +60 infra and both confusion and damage gaze effects.
* All the gear that came with a summoned creature should now
    vanish when it does, even if it is on the floor, in the
    player's inventory, etc.
* Summoned creatures no longer leave corpses.
* Fixed horrid single bug with improperly overloaded Item::StatiOff
    that caused decastaves not to disappear, summoned creatures' 
    gear to persist when the creature vanished, dispellings on
    items not to recover properly, etc. Basically, if it was
    timed and associated with an item, it wouldn't work.
* When you polymorph into a powerful creature, the CR of the
    creature you changed into (min 0) is now added to your
    own character level to determine your ECL -- Effective
    Character Level -- for the purpose of calculating XP
    awards for any kills you make. Put simply, you get less
    kill experience when polymorphed into something tough.
* Polymorph can no longer be cancelled, nor can it be re-cast
    over an existing casting.
* Magic, feat and inherant typed bonuses to Strength, Dexterity
    and Constitution no longer apply while polymorphed.
* Casting a spell while polymorphed now adds 15 segments to the
    casting time due to the unfamiliar body.
* Fixed bug where polymorphing into a creature with inherant 
    spellcasting (i.e., naga) increased your real caster level.

Incursion 0.6.2F
* The spell "distance distortion" no longer angers
  allies or neutrals caught within its area. (Pseudonatural
  creatures use this spell, and this should fix
  a cascade of problems with summoning them -- when
  they are allied, they don't use /black tentacles/
  because it's on the list of spells that are very
  annoying to have allies cast.)
* Verified that creatures with gaze attacks will not
  gaze at their allies or at neutrals.
* Gaze attacks are hardwired not to have alignment
  effects until I can work out a more sensible case-
  by-case basis for dealing with them, unless the
  creature is a former friendly.
* Semirath now exempts outsiders from his "no killing
  non-evil sapients" rule.
* Nausea from Semirath should now last 3d6 turns.
* Semirath's vengeance now only bestows one curse; used
  to be two.
* Ekliazeh's (positive and negative) intervention intervals
  increased, so that you don't lose so MUCH equipment should
  you happen to anger him.

Incursion 0.6.2E
* Fixed one possible source of the false "magical
  fear" message on skirmishing monsters (Holderhek).
* Allies using /Spook/ should no longer cause inter-
  party conflict.  (The elven cat party conflict 
  issue can be tracked back to weird interaction 
  between bugs -- spook is one of those spells allies
  are never supposed to cast/have active, but there
  is also a complicated-to-fix issue with Spook not
  terminating right, so your allies could still have
  it active.

Incursion 0.6.2D
* Finally fixed bug with hostile horses -- it turned
    out to be an issue with the /mount/ and /phantom
    steed/ spells; you were being put on horses that
    were never "really" on your team, and wierdness
    ensued.
* Added a clause where when your mount becomes 
    frightened, at the start of the next round you
    get a Ride check that either calm it (success)
    or causes you to be thrown from the mount on a
    failure.
* Fixed Erich so he now uses the normal chivalry code
    for calculating chivalry stuff, except he's never
    offended if your act treacherous to creatures he
    (as Lawful Evil) does not consider people. Revised
    his restriction text in the manual slightly to make
    the intent clearer as well.

Incursion 0.6.2C
* Player will no longer get alignment ding if one
    ally accidentally hits another (as with ranged
    combat, frex). Player will still get dinged if
    ally was given order to attack neutrals.
* Player will now get alignment ding for requesting
    a neutral to attack his enemies, if attacking
    them himself would give a ding.

Incursion 0.6.2B
* Fixed "Eightfold Prince" crash
* Fixed stupid typo preventing new "honorable at the
    beginning" checks from working correctly for
    knockdown.
* Fixed issue where monsters would still use special
    attacks (i.e., crushing a grappled target, breath
    weapons) in situations where it would cause their
    master alignment issues.
* Added code so that when a monster turns neutral (for
    example, as a result of Offer Terms), it will stop
    grappling or engulfing creatures that are no longer
    its enemies, and other creatures will do likewise
    to it.

Incursion 0.6.2A
* Removed a hardcoded breakpoint that I put in trying
  to figure out how folks lose favor with the Multitude.
  This was the cause of the Rurik and Barendd crashes --
  the game crashed whenever you commit a good act like
  killing an inherantly evil creature with good intent
  (desired Good alignment).
* Fixed the bug from (Zakfienal, Violent DonkeyNose,
  WaterDangerHobo, Sammal Onhalm) saves that caused
  crash due to attack roll code not expecting a Trap
  in the EItem slot, only a weapon; this is the crash
  that only happens in the release versions, not the
  debug versions, for some strange reason.

Changes in 0.6.2
* Fixed bugged Vest of Health -- now protects you when
    it is activated by absorbing damage.
* Fixed Lenses of the Soul resisting fear, used to say
    it granted complete immunity but not work, now it
    grants a + to saves and should work.
* Fixed crash involving building a monster description
    with more than 32 items (i.e., Eberk, examining
    goblin monks, etc.)
* Fixed bug causing Asherath priests to get WAY TOO MUCH
    bonus favor from inherant bonuses to attributes.
* Fixed parameter mismatch crash from "The <EActor> 
  protects <his:EActor> <EItem>."
* Added fatigue costs to some psionic powers.
* Added headers to the Keybinding legend dialog box to
    make the meaning of the key listings clearer.
* Renamed the '.' command "wait" for clarity, to avoid
    confusion with the rest ('z') command.
* Warriors and paladins now have a strong Will saving 
  throw.
* Fixed crash bug opening one of two chests on ground
  (Whitney Greenbottle).    
* Fixed infinite looping / stack overflow crash involving
  vials of holy water and/or alchemist's fire.
* Analysis of saved games (Vorkai Tauth II, Zol the Wise)
  reveals that stati gained from class resources outside
  the AddAbility framework sometimes get corrupted by their
  Mag being altered. This is the bug that causes many strange
  effects (priests needing spellbooks, weavecrafters losing
  the ability to control teleport, inability to learn spells,
  etc.) Verified that it is not caused by dispel magic. More
  investigation needed.
* Analyzed Lyle Highhill slingstone crash; cannot duplicate.
* Removed "Generated the Spider" type messages.
* Black Orcs no longer have "Bestow Curse".
* Hopefully fixed the issue with the game trying to get you
    to automatically coup-de-grace when it won't work.
* Hopefully fixed wraparound bug where items in store cost
    1 gp for low-Cha characters -- not certain about this.
* Scroll strain damage is now [Scroll Level x 2] rather than
    mana-based, to avoid unfair instadeath when reading an
    unknown scroll that turns out to be a low-level buff with
    a large mana cost.
* Fixed bug where doing a character dump automatically ID's
    everything in inventory -- now, inventory and ground items
    are only id'd on dumps made from the gravestone screen.

The "Alignment/Allies Fix"
* Fixed a bug that caused gods to *seem* to be angry
  when they weren't really after a favorable intervention
  (i.e., the multitude sending you demon aid).
* When one ally incidentally damages another, the party
  leader now gets a Diplomacy check (DC 15) to diffuse
  intra-party conflict.
* Implemented Transgression Hints
* Player is no longer responsible alignment-wise for a
    party member using acid, making unchivalrous attacks,
    attacking fleeing creatures, clipping neutrals with
    area spells or using mental coercion effects.
* Overall numeric effect of NPC acts on alignment reduced.
* NPCs no longer cast acid spells if they or their leader
    is good-aligned, and also avoid spells with bad
    alignment descriptors.
* Messages NG/TN/NE characters recieve when moving around
    on the law/chaos spectrum are now more intuitive and
    less likely to be mistaken for "you did evil".
* Situations where the target becomes afraid/prone/stuck/etc.
    as a result of your attack and then takes more bonus
    damage no longer have the potential to lead to unfair
    chivalry violations. (I hope -- if you still get this,
    please let me know!)
* Attacking fleeing creatures does not move LN/TN/CN chars
    closer to evil; only LG/NG/CG closer to neutral aligns.
    This should make it easier to play non-evil characters.
* Triggering a trap or suffering divine wrath will no longer
    cause NPCs or mounts to be hostile to the player/leader.
* The "hostile to horse" was caused by the horse actually
    being hostile to rider, and thus no longer neutral to
    things the rider was neutral to, being an out-of-control
    animal. Now, when your horse becomes hostile to you, it
    automatically throws you off.
* Creatures using skirmish tactics no longer count against
    you if you attack them as they flee; further, they no
    longer give the strange message about "magical fear" if
    you try to offer them terms.
* If a prone, blind or stuck creature hits you while prone,
    blind or stuck, you can now hit them back without
    violating chivalry.
* Robe of Scintillating Colors should no longer piss off
    allies or cause alignment issues.
* Fixed a horrid bug with the internal math of how the sum 
    CR of your allies was calculated; should work better
    now, albiet a bit more restrictive in some cases.
* Immotian and the Multitude should not send more aid than
    you can handle anymore.
* Substantially improved the code that calls ItHitMe when
    magic affects a monster so that allies stop turning on
    the player from trap effects and such.
* Now, you only suffer an alignment ding for you or your
    allies attacking a creature that is neutral to EVERYONE
    IN YOUR PARTY.

Changes in 0.6.1A
* Implemented the Break verb to make it more convenient
    for barbarians to destroy magical items.
* (Hopefully) fixed issue where you retain bonuses from
    equipment you lose in unconventional ways.
* Fixed grammar code mistakes with inherantly plural 
    items like boots.
* Fixed issue with pressing [ESC] at various ChoicePrompts
    causing strange results.
* Fixed issue with the titles to menus (i.e., Lorecall)
    being rendered as corrupt garbage characters.
* Fear immunity and bonuses to save vs. fear are now
    factored into Intimidate attempts.
* Fixed additional things broken by the retained bonuses
    from lost equipment fix.
* Fixed bug with first two letters of container equipment
    type headers disappearing sometimes.
* Fixed bug with two backpacks, where one was empty but
    the container cursor treated it as if it was the other
* Tested examining a blue goblin monk -- cannot duplicate
    reported crash
* Fixed bug with dropping items in a container using the
    container cursor.
* Highlight options moved to limits/warnings group so all
    option panels display correctly at 1024x768 with 12x16.
* When you make multiple rolls for a skill and take the
    best, all the rolls are now shown to illustrate this.
* Fixed "Chemise" crash upon selecting "Show All Feats" --
    the LMenu window was hardcoded to 80x50 minimums and
    was overwriting the boundry of the display buffer.
* Gnomes now only start with an arbalest if they are
    proficient using it.
* Added 1280x960 and 1920x1080 resolution support.
* Fixed bug where a successful counterspell would turn a
    spell that has no target (like /flaming sphere/)
    "back on its caster", actually doing nothing at all.
* Possibly fixed issue with monsters taking multiple
    actions (i.e., casting multiple spells) in the same
    turn for no discernable reason -- counterspell? Needs
    more investigation. Let me know if the "counterspell
    loop" still happens.

Changes in 0.6.1
* Fixed issues with Ring of Polymorphing
* Coins and Hearthstones of Onanda now weigh less
* Fixed inventory [TAB] crash
* Fixed inventory slowdowns
* Fixed keyboard buffer issue -- character or cursor
    now stops moving as soon as movement key is released
* Fixed crash upon praying to Ekliazeh for aid during
    prayer timeout (ungart save)
* Fixed crash bug with charmed creatures becoming resentful
    of charmer causes crash when their target queue is full,
    usually manifesting on changing dungeon levels (Rathak).
* Fixed crash bug with monsters repeatedly trying to wear
    some types of magical armor (Win 16)
* Bardic music is now cancelled correctly by fields of
    magical silence.
* Implemented Mass Fascination, Hymn of the Phoenix Arisen
    and Spellbreaker Chant bardsongs.
* Undead that should have the M_MINDLESS flag given it, and
    many types of undead made not to flee in combat, though
    animalistic (ghouls) and intelligent (mummies) undead
    still can.
* Bulletproofed the code to make sure that mindless and
    inherantly evil creatures don't count as "people" for
    alignment purposes.
* Fixed crash on character sheet feats description caused
    by planning domain granting the depricated Anchor Spell
    feat; it now grants Extend Spell, and even if a character
    gets an unknown feat, this won't crash anymore.
* You can now scroll the cursor in the Magic Manager by
    holding down the up/down key, and it will stop moving
    as soon as the key is released.
* Offer Terms and Cow now satisfy Dwarven Focus. Note that 
    Quell does not.
* Manual corrected regarding druids having hands and being
    able to use silver/mithril items. (These things have been
    depricated for a while now.)
* Confirmed that eating spiders and snakes does not anger the
    Multitude using Wizard Mode.
* Initiating Barter from the Yuse menu no longer causes Cow
    instead.
* See Invisibility potion added; guaranteed one such potions in
    the Entry Chamber, more in the shop and beginner's kit.
* Added twilight salve alchemical item, to allow alchemists to
    manufacture something allowing them to see invisible.
* Poltergiests should now never appear before dlev 2.
* The "clarity of mind" divine aid effect now lets you see
    invisible if you are currently being menaced by etherial
    or otherwise invisible creatures.
* Fixed /remove curse/ crash upon targeting door or feature.
* Elves using Manifestation can now see creatures on the etherial
    plane as well as strike them.
* Fixed HORRID bug responsible for the monster AI moving
    monsters toward players despite being unable to see them --
    incorporeals zeroing in on player, enemies following hidden
    character, etc.
* Monster wanderlust now works properly.
* Spectres, poltergeists, blessed souls, avenging spirits, ghosts,
    etc. are now native to the etherial, not astral, plane.
* Fixed a bug that prevented gods from transporting their 
    followers to safety properly as a form of divine aid.
* Craft, Decipher Script, Knowledge (Theyra), Knowledge (Theology),
    Ride, Search and Spot are now considered familiar skills, and
    all characters can invest a limited number of ranks in them.
* Removed depricated skill Food Preservation from race/class skill 
    lists in help.
* Added balance tweak after the SomethingAwful mind flayer rampage:
    all polymorph effects cut out after the player has gained
    experience 20 times, so you can't poly into something hideously
    powerful and just _stay like that_.
* Characters _should_ now be able to drop an item in the in-air
    slot even if they have no hands, to prevent the game from
    getting locked into the inventory screen if you gain an item
    (as a god-gift, say) while polymorphed.
* Fixed crash caused by attempting to use your breath weapon while
    polymorphed.
* Fixed memory corruption resulting from polymorph messages.
* Removed incorrect code preventing use of breath weapons in
    some situations.
* Bug with plant ur-dragon breath weapon _hopefully_ fixed -- let
    me know ASAP if it happens again!
* Several issues related to /animate objects/ fixed; I think the
    crash relating to it is fixed, too; let me know if it shows
    up again!
* Scrolls and Wands now only consume 1/3rd mana on a failed use
    attempt, to make their use more viable for warriors and others
    lacking Use Magic or Decipher Script.
* Armor now provides coverage-based protection against the special
    damage "bleeding" type, just like attribute damage etc.
* Fixed Stati.__Allocated error upon kicking doors repeatedly.
* Magical armor made notably more common in the dungeon.
* Sacrificing cursed items to remove them fixed.
* Multiclass XP penalty verified to work the way it is described
  as working in the Incursion manual (which is different from the
  canon version).
* Fixed issue with trap effects being treated as spell effects,
    leading to strange messages ("Your own firebolt strikes you...")
* Fixed store overflow bug
* Fixed barter/store slowdown bug
* Container listing now scrolls to keep cursor always visible.
* Coin generation rebalanced so that there is more money in the
    game, and it is found in higher denominations.
* Characters can now kick doors while afraid.
* Decreased the rarity of specific weapons (i.e., Quickblade,
    Oathbow, Sword of the Planes, Holy Avenger) and verified
    that they are being generated.
* Made 'building' rooms more common, to decrease the chance of
    levels without chests.
* Good aligned characters now recieve more experience than others
    for resolving encounters with Quell/Offer Terms/Cow.

* Detailed item names now shown in AutoLoop and AutoDrop selection
    windows.
* Implemented an option for softer palette colors with lighter
    "dark" colors.
* Changed minimum resolution to 80x48 (from 80x50), so now people
    with 1024x768 play area can use the more readable 12x16 font.
* Added support for widescreen resolutions -- 1280x768, 1280x800
    and 1920x1200.
* Incursion now starts a new installation with no Options.Dat file
    at 1024x768 with 12x16 font, in both windowed and fullscreen
    mode, if possible, to make things easier on new players.
* Added messages when font or resolution defaults to a lower
    setting, making it clear to the user what happened and how
    to fix it.
* Fixed Hesani's holy symbol so that it doesn't make all undead
    hostile to the bearer.
* Fixed issue with using social options like quell on creatures
    that you aggravate -- now it's disallowed, when it used to
    result in "formerly peaceful" creatures.
* Fixed bug where you could use the Barter screen and a friendly
    NPC to identify any item -- now, only designated shopkeepers
    list all items as identified on the barter screen.
* You can now stand up while in a pit, preventing heavy armor
    characters from getting stuck in a pit unable to take off
    their armor because they are prone!
* Verified by testing that you can sacrifice both companions and
    charmed creatures to Xel. (If anyone has problems with this,
    let me know and I'll try to track it down more.)
* Verified using Quell does not penalize followers of Xel.
* If there is no way for a starting item to be stored on your
    person at the start of the game, it will now be placed at
    your feet at the enterance to the dungeon. This should prevent
    cases where players are "cheated" of perk items. Let me know
    if any more cases of this arise.

Changes in 0.6.0C
* Implemented two new inventory macros, AutoLoot and 
    AutoDrop, to ease managing inventory.

    permanently afraid as his first blessing level.

    work correctly.

    to the +10 magic bonus -- oops!

    truly crit-immune.
* Fixed monsters keeping bonuses from items they have 
    physically lost, such as Expertise bonus after being
    disarmed.
* Fixed crash caused by toggling fullscreen mode on the
    barter screen.
* Warriors now choose weapon focus AFTER choosing other
    feats (again -- it broke with the War domain shield
    fix), so exotic weapon warriors don't waste their
    focus.
* Fixes to accomodate AZERTY keyboard -- users can now
    set a keyboard layout by changing Incursion.cfg; see
    comments in that file for more info.
* Amulet of Strangulation now prevents time-consuming
    activities like tempering swords.
* You are now told how many hours are spent when you do

* Experience-related messages now account for drained
    experience so as not to be nonsensical (FS#193)
* Immotian smiting your foes with Order's Wrath no longer
    triggers gravestones or tombs.
* General fix should prevent god-spawned effects from
    triggering gravestones or influencing the player's
    alignment.
* Walking in acid fog no longer turns you evil, nor does
    acid damage caused by traps or divine intervention.
* Acid fog no longer deals rust damage to equipment if
    the wearer has Acid Resistance 6+.

* Skill Manager header text now aligns correctly.
* Monochrome Help now affects spell descriptions shown
    in the spell manager as well.
* Captivating feat now grants additional gold the way it
    is supposed to.
* Fixed crash bug (Iosofel) caused by cursed lenses of

    Lightning (second Iosefel crash).
* Fixed issue with players being able to be crowned by
    gods, when crowning isn't implemented yet and does
    not do anything (max favor lev is 9 now).
* Character sheet now lists favor, favor level and favor
    penalty; this is a temporary thing to help me get a
    feel for the numbers in actual play.
* Fixed the problem with monsters having caster level 0
    or lower; this was significant because it could lead
    to negative dice values error messages.
* Aiswin now hates his worshippers using magical effects
    with the [Light] descriptor.
* Skill points are now gained retroactively from permanent
    increases in Intelligence (i.e., training). Magical
    items (headband of intellect) still don't grant skill
    points, by design.
* The saving throw to close with the wielder of a reach
    weapon now lists the comparative size modifier sepa-
    rately rather than factoring it in invisibly, so that
    players can better understand the mechanics of Reach
    weapons.
* Weapon save DCs (reach, stunning, knockdown, etc.) have
    been overhauled in general, and the way they are
    calculated is better documented now. You get bonuses

    working correctly.

Changes in 0.5.9A
* Spook (and other field-spells) now work correctly with
    AutoBuff.
* Fixed bugs where spells affecting all allies (Bless,
    Valor) would not affect the caster himself.
* Since fear has become so prominent in Incursion, I
    changed Valor to grant a +5 save bonus rather than
    full immunity, for balance's sake.
* New Spell: Sticks to Snakes
* Massive mana rewrite hopefully solves mana corruption
    issues, from persistant scrolls, service spells and
    mana stones.
* Fixed bug causing multiple detect spells to function
    intermittently (i.e., detect evil + detect undead
    would only detect whichever was cast first). Quick
    testing suggests that this fixed the problems with
    Detect Monsters and hiding as well -- you can now
    both detect hiding monsters and detect monsters
    while hiding. Let me know if you have any wierd
    detect behaviour in 0.5.9A
* Fixed bug causing the duplication of field effects by
    jumping, teleporting, etc.

Changes in 0.5.9

    obscurement, stinking cloud, thunderbeast fumes, horn

    (globe of shadows, deeper darkness, animate shadows)
    can now negate each other.
* Ranger re-balanced to avoid front-loading
* Ranger and bard saving throws fixed

    effect-processing code to do this, so please play
    casters and item-users and let me know if I broke
    anything else!
* Post-reincarnation skill point bug fixed.
* Loremaster prerequisites fixed -- note that skills are
    based off skill ratings _unmodified by skill kits or
    attribute-boosting magic items or spells_.
* Added cheetah as halfling paladin mount.
* Added special rules exception allowing small creatures
    (halflings, gnomes) to ride other small creatures
    (like riding dogs).
* Spell-like abilities now use character level as a
    caster level.
* New Spells: Holy Orb, Necrosynthesis
* Fixed dwarf, gnome and halfling glyphs in 16x12 and 12x16
    fonts.
* Fixed major, notable glitch in the spell interpreter
    noticed while implementing holy orb.
* Fixed Amakiir crash on drinking potion.
* Fixed poltergiest natural invisibility.
* Fixed blessed soul hostility issue, which was really a
    glitch in the entire targeting system where NPCs would
    think the PC was hostile to them based on traditional
    feuds (i.e., living hate the dead); also, living hate
    the dead now excepts blessed souls and other inherantly
    good undead, but not good individuals of normally evil
    breeds, like good liches or whatever.
* Healing yourself is no longer a good act!
* Updated feat trees in manual.
* MSVCR71D.DLL now included with distribution.
* "Slow" inventory fixed.
* Elves can now use Necromancy spells that are also Abjuration,
    such as "Protection from Undead".
* Hopefully fixed the issue with weapons not wielded granting
    bonuses.
* Using Legend Lore, or identifying monsters with knowledge 
    skills, now trains Int -- and the cap for ID-ing this way
    is now higher than the cap for id-by-experiment. Let me
    know if this is good, bad, broken, etc.
* Fixed bugs related to regeneration messages.

Changes in 0.5.8
* Transmute Spell fixed
* Dragon tattoo does more damage
* Mantis tattoo gives more armor
* Misc. tattoo changes / fixes
* Tattoo Mystic requirements lowered
* "Brottir Skyforge" crash fixed -- caused by dispel traps
    recursively dispelling themselves, and by the mis-setting
    of e.efNum.
* Monsters can now cast /dispel magic/ as an attack spell.
* Bug where enemies lose the player's parry mod, dex mod,
    etc. when surprised fixed with a kludge.
* Enemy defending with unrolled Ride check, caused by above 
    bug making enemy's DC lower than 0, fixed. 
* Scintillating Colors XPrint formatting crash fixed.
* Can't duplicate "order to hide" error, could easily before,
    thus I assume I fixed it while fixing other things.

    alliesShouldntCast list when they get recruited and
    become an ally.

    for high-level characters to appease.
* Fixed bug that prevented Immotian from accepting magic
    staves as sacrifices.
* Books are now worth more as sacrifices to Immotian.
* Message fix: "The aranea changes into an aranea." ->
    "The aranea changes back into its natural form."

    number of levels when she is angry.

* New feats for monks: Reed in the Wind, Defensive Throw,
    Great Throw, Chi Strike, Falling Star Strike, Freeze
    the Lifeblood, Choke Hold, Earth's Embrace, Power
    Kick, Flying Kick, Circle Kick and Pain Touch.
* Added new good and bad interventions for Ekliazeh and
    good intervention for Immotian; these were missing
    before as a result of oversight.
* Fixed bug causing Multitude to demon-spam the player,
    and other gods' similar intervention-spam.
* Fixed targeting issue with Holy Smite, Chaos Hammer,
    Unholy Blight and Order's Wrath.
* Fixed a HORRID bug that caused the Encounter Generator
    to sometimes do HORRID things, like assume spitting
    frogs were fire elementals.
* Added Insect Plague, Summon Swarm to alliesShouldntCast
* New spells: Create Corporeal Undead, Create Spectral
    Undead; also new undead: blessed soul and avenging
    spirit.
* God docs for Maeve, Sabine, Multitude and Erich.
* Fixed a wide set of bugs with monster spell access:
    innate abilities not showing up as service spells,
    1 in 8 innate abilities not being recognized, etc.

    to hostile creatures.

* All goblin encampment occupants should now be hostile.
* Fixed bug giving goblin viziers too-high spellcasting.
* Fixed "infinite counterspell" issue (hopefully). Note that
    there has always been a tactical option to set to
    determine when you will counterspell!
* Altered prompts and inventory/spell managers so they don't
    accept held-down keys as input anymore 
    (catch thrown+--more--=death)
* Keybinding screen fixed
* Player now automatically recieves first action after doing
    a controlled ascent or descent to a different level.
    (Monsters can still act first when you fall into a
    chasm, which seems sensible.)
* Creatures who are cowed or have accepted terms will no longer
    pick up items at all, and are timed out longer than the 
    player is.
* Climbing on the ceiling now requires skill checks vs. DC 25
    every 1 in 30 steps; rolling less than 35 costs 1 fatigue.
* Failing to equip an item no longer gives you the item's
    bonuses (see: equip cloak while wearing magical robes)
* Falling damage now stuns the player, unless he uses Tumble
    or slow fall.
* Walking over pits now requires confirmation, and auto-run
    stops for them.
* Scrolls (and other crafted items) now priced correctly.
* Fixed reverse charge bug.
* Weapon swap refactored to deal with bug and other issues.
* Auto-Run logic improved.
* Fixed 100% slowing issue (with a kludge). Still need to think
    about penalty stacking for RotF.
* Lots of (undefined ##) descriptions fixed.
* Fixed Sabine's Lightning Bolt ability caster level bug.

Changes in 0.5.7A
* Allies of the player are now barred from casting a
  list of "obnoxious" spells:
  const char * alliesShouldntCast[] = {
    "Obscurement", "Rainstorm", "Rusting Grasp", 
    "Natural Erosion", "Spook", "Deeper Darkness",
    "Whirlpool", "Ring of Blades", "Etherealness",
    "Blasphemy", "Grease", "Pyrotechnics", "Web",
    "Electric Loop", "Visage of Death", "Levitation",
    "Evard's Black Tentacles", "Cloudkill",
    "Dream", "Nightmare", "Lesser Symbol", 
    "Fireball", "Color Burst", "Confusion",
    "Immortal Grandeur", "Hallucinatory Terrain",
    "Mirage Arcana", NULL };
* Balance checks succeed on natural 20.
* Logic problems in SkillCheck() fixed.
* For simplicity's sake, until this can be handled

    commented out for now.

Changes in 0.5.7

   (65 - [Concentration x 2])% of their total, to a
   mimnimum of 20% at concentration +23.
* Revised weapons table to make the weapons more
    comparable and competitive -- large swords are less
    uber; staves no longer rely on Strength.
* New items: Scrolls of Enchant Armor (plus, fortification,
    feather-light, graceful, life-keeping and resistance).
* Potion of Vitality made into staple item.
* Feather-Light armor only imposes 1/2 the Swim penalty.
* New armor quality: life-keeping
* Coverage now blocks special damage, as described in the
    help under "Armor vs. Special Attacks".
* Turning now costs only fatigue, not mana.
* To aid warriors in using the new scrolls, Decipher Script
    is now a skill that allies can aid you with.
* A character's elemental resistances now add directly to
    the hardness of her equipment, so a Helm of Clear Sound
    helps defend against /shatter/.
* Armor protects a character's amulet, bracers and girdle
    from slashing, piercing and blunt damage similarly
    to the character himself.
* Class mana dice changed; mages now get 1d20 base/level.
* Mana now has a single flat multiplier based on total
    character level; this gives everyone slightly more
    mana.
* New Feat: Roll With It
* Fixed a bug with damage modifiers not being displayed
    properly at times.
* Maeve will now turn armor feather-light.
* The screen now redraws _mostly_ correctly on toggling
    between fullscreen and windowed mode. 
* Many gods will now intercede to negate a critical hit
    that would kill a player or reduce her to less than

    neutral to the player character (without being ordered
    to).

    to help the player when she's supposed to.
* Incursion now recognizes numpad enter (I hope). :-)

    map to be drawn (I hope -- this is hard to test).

    huge timecosts.
* Updated god writeups for Hesani, Immotian, Khasrach,
    Essiah, Zurvash, Kysul.

    with the item selection prompt.

    character sheet screen.
* A few vestigal errors with the way the windows were
    placed based on constant values left after the
    Allegro port are now fixed.
* The "monster has >1000 items" error will now appear
    only once per run of the executable, and now only
    comes after 10,000 items (but I suspect it's
    irrelevant because the huge inventory is a bug)
* Bug where curing petrification in fact caused it to
    occur immediately is now fixed.
* Decastave is now +2 regardless of caster level.
* Rapiers, quarterstaves and stilettos don't use Str.

    correctly when cast on a player.
* _Hopefully_ magical robes and helmets no longer show
    bizarre properties; let me know if you still get
    this!

    they can wear light armor and still cast, and do
    not need a holy symbol.

Changes in 0.5.6A
* Holy symbols can now be equipped in the neck slot.
* AutoBuff command works again.
* Number Pad keys should work

    in play, otherwise just terminate.

    in the pipe.

Changes in 0.5.6

    fullscreen/window toggle, etc.

    or other deep liquid
* There is now a switch to turn Demoralize off.
* The vicious weapon quality now only activates if you have
    2/3rds or more of your HP.
* The tightrope bridge now works correctly over water and
    magma, I hope.
* Minor mana trap message fixed.
* Bizarre templates (spiked, razorjaw, half-fiend, etc.)
    have been made far rarer.
* Vampire watermelon renamed vampire melon; sponge beast
    renamed aether sponge; above and accursed cow all made
    very rare.
* /shatter/ damage is now 1d4/level, scaled after 9th.
* Half-Celestial restricted to sapient creatures to prevent
    the half-celestial vampire watermelon thing.
* Assuming class is chosen before attributes, paladins can
    no longer start with unholy, chaotic, corrosive or
    vampiric weapons as perks, nor items with the [Evil]
    or [Chaotic] descriptors.
* Assuming race is chosen before attributes, small races
    cannot start with Large items as perks.
* Fixed bug causing brewing poisons to crash the game, as
    well as adding a more coherant message if you don't
    know any formulas; fixed other minor poisoncraft bugs.
* Fixed bug with maximum scroll level scribable being based
    on Alchemy rather than Knowledge (Magic).
* Fixed scrolls and other crafted items costing 0 xp & 0 gp.
* Investigated monsters casting spells (like command) at
    themselves; seems pathological and difficult to fix,
    no solution yet.
* Money re-balancing: all costs to make or purchase items
    cut by two-thirds, and first three dungeon levels have
    more money now.
* Detect Natural Traps no longer makes animal companions
    turn hostile. This is a flag that needs to be on certain
    spells, so let me know if you find any more that do
    this!
* Mage armor now cancels or cannot be cast when real armor
    is worn.
* Neutral endgame creatures issue hopefully fixed.

    metal items on dungeon level 3 and 7.

    again.
* Rangers now have the skills Knowledge (Nature, Oceans
    and Theyra).
* Alignment fixed so that killing fleeing creatures is only
    bad for lawfuls if they are sapient; crawling claws
    and monkeys are immune.
* Holy symbols are now their own class of items, rather
    than being treated as special amulets. This fixes
    several bugs and bad behaviours related to them.
* One effect of this is that a priest can put his holy
    symbol in his ready hand and it counts as equipped.
* Holy symbols count as a +4 skill kit for Know (Theo).
* Wands of Opening now opens doors
* New Item: Wand of Dismissal
* Wands of Alacrity work differently now -- they only
    last for a limited time, and have a plus.
* "Etherealness" is now a level 6 priest (and level 8
    mage) spell the way it should be.
* Traps generated in water / deep liquid (magma/slime)
    squares are removed after level gen; this prevents
    the reduce trap / water item loss thing, as well as
    being sensible logically.

* You can no longer Cow creatures that are already
    frightened.
* Rope Trick is now level 3; Apportation now level 2.
* Fixed bug displaying "Hide in Plain Sight"
* Shadowdancer level abilities rearranged for balance.
* Erase spell now works properly, on Guardian Runes and
    otherwise
* Dispel Magic now affects guardian runes (with a good
    roll -- it's hard), magical traps, symbols, etc. --
    these have fairly high set caster levels to avoid
    the spell being overpowered.
* More creatures now carry rope.
* Casting /rope trick/ now consumes rope.
* Haste is now the 4th level Time Domain spell; it's still
    3rd for mages.
* Zen Defense limited WRT armor
* Righteous Might and Divine Power rewritten for balance,
    and to ensure they have different and distinct concepts
    behind them.
* Inventory manipulation takes place in realtime now,
    giving monsters their actions and warning the player
    when he becomes threatened.
* Prerequisites for feats and prestige classes are now based
    only on inherant values, not bonuses from items or spells,
    or the effects of attribute damage. This was a complex fix
    and I probably missed something; let me know if you spot
    someplace where this doesn't work.
* Fixed a crash bug involving pressing [Esc] on the 'select a
    class' menu for multiclassing
* Fixed _an_ InBounds(x,y) error, but I doubt it's _the_ 
    InBounds(x,y) error (from descending to dlev 2). Let me know
    if you still get that on 0.5.5?

Changes in 0.5.4A
* Increased kill experience for characters of level 4+ by
  about 30% to refect the "Sammal Warrior 8" game where a
  character with 25% XP bonus was level 8 at the end of the
  game.
* Friendly creatures only give 1/3rd experience when you
  kill them, to avoid giving an unintended edge to evil
  characters.
* Fixed crash bug involving Expert Tactician and ranged 
  attacks
* Fixed bug that prevented ranged attack targeting properly
    against monsters with cursed weapons (Zik Targeting Bug)
* Fixed inexplicable "This must be a Potion of Fire Breath".
* Fixed "InBounds(x,y)" bug caused by Rope Trick and
    vision tests for creatures on one map by those on
    another
* Fixed Glyph of Warding crash bug (Vorn Wyndyl II)
* Fixed "InBounds" error on dungeon descent (Kesh, Orc Paladin)
* Fixed Remove Curse potions for real this time

Changes in 0.5.4
* All cure spells now available as service spells
* Bartering with creatures with templates granting service
  spells no longer causes Stati corruption
* 'bsp' error on fountain drinking suppressed
* Request Item crash bug fixed
* Players can now get service spells from allied
    creatures for free.
* Succubus ethereality and gender fixed
* Unaware creatures no longer get AoOs on hidden creatures
* You can stop sprinting with the Cancel command now
* Healing treating blindness now works properly
* Attributes no longer train when inherant bonus is maxed,
    to avoid 'profound wastefulness' message spam.
* Saving should no longer take game-time
* Monsters should no longer be able to equip tower shields
* Monsters no longer become hostile over EF_NOTBAD spells,
    and animate shadows is fixed to affect only hostiles
* Fixed bug with favor-calculation that stopped followers
    of Asherath from advancing.
* Powered up Aiswin's level gifts a bit, and gave him level
    gifts for 8 & 9 to match the other gods.
* Potions of Remove Curse now remove curses on both characters
    and items, just like the priest spell does. 
* Fixed crash related to ranger tracking.
* Fixed a major bug with Mara's favor calculation.
* Your favor penalty for aid is now alluded to under spiritual 
    state on the character sheet
* God anger is more moderate now because only the highest anger
    from a single act it gained -- so killing a friendly by
    suprise (+5 by suprise, +3 friendly) will give only +5 anger
    rather than +8.
* The 'Seek Insight' function of prayer now tells you exactly
    what your god will do for you based on your current favor.
* Favor gain changed back to normal rate
* General religion-system help in the Adventuring section added
* Sacrificing to the 'blatant' evil gods is now an evil act;
    sacrificing to the subtle ones (Erich/Maeve) is not.
* Aiswin, Asherath, Ekliazeh, Mara, Semirath, Xavias, Xel all
    recieved specific manual update
* Added spells Vigor and Heightened Senses, and Wand of Opening
    (currently works only on chests, not doors; will fix later)
* Nondetection effects no longer conceal their user from 
    Blindsight or Tremorsense.
* Death Attack now has a range of 30 feet.
* Feat "Shoot from Cover" removed until I can figure out how to
    balance it.
* Characters now gain 2 base feats at level 1
* Ancient Library now guaranteed on dlev 2, less tomes in AL
* Summoned creatures no longer grant XP when slain
* Limited teamwork with skills implemented, probably still buggy
* Monsters with negative Challenge Ratings have skill ratings
    calculated as if they were CR 1.
* Fixed monsters not actually getting all the skills from 
  templates.


Changes in 0.5.3A
* Tanglefoot bags don't trigger gravestones
* Divine feats are accessable
* Summoning crash fixed

Changes in 0.5.3
* Sacrifce moves you closer to the recieving god's alignment if
  that is also your desired alignment
* Petrification stoppable with acid or lizard corpses
* All characters get +2 SP/level
* Monster alignments vary -- you can now meet neutral orcs, etc.
* Alignment bonuses to hit, Will save and XP
* Vortices have their own class of incorporeality, are not
  invisible and cannot move through stone, though you still need
  magical weapons to hit them.
* You can now pray for aid or cast still vocalized spells while
  paralyzed.
* You do not recieve a Strength bonus to damage when attacking
  incorporeal creatures unless your weapon is ghost touch.
* The "calculated favor", which is something like XP with your
  god, is tripled. This will probably make it too easy to advance
  too quickly with gods, but I want to try it out to see how the
  gods balance out and let people get farther in the game.
* /dispel magic/ and related traps can no longer strip away
  abilities gained from a body or template (like infravision)
* Added Potions of Faerie and Light
* Equipment-damaging traps toned down
* Kobold warrens have lots of traps
* Fountains can now restore lost experience on a good roll
* Druids with infravision now keep it when they wildshape. Skill
  bonuses stay when polymorphed, too.
* Animal companions no longer get attacked by allies
* Detonate crash fixed
* All dice get rolled on critical hits, now 
* Monsters no longer regenerate in the Rope Trick e-space, and
    several related deeper map/terminal design flaws fixed
* Fixed Lesser Planar Conjuration, kinda
* Fixed armor bypass / natural armor absorbs message contradiction
* You can now batter down doors with blunt weapons without crashing
  the game; slashing weapons do 1/3 damage and doors are immune to
  piercing damage.
* Attribute damage/drain has messages now.
* Preserving power now lets you keep the scroll.
* You can identify scrolls after reading them with Knowledge (Magic).
* To avoid message spam, all messages concerning monsters charging
  and/or breaking off their charge have been suppressed until a way
  can be found to display them only when appropriate.
